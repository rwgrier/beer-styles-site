Beer Style Guidelines 2021.2

Revamped how universal search works within the app. 

The following guide sections didn't load properly from universal search: 
* BJCP 2015: American Amber Ale
* BJCP 2015: California Common
* BJCP 2015: American Brown Ale

These should be fixed and available from universal search.
