# C2A. New England Cider

_This is a cider made with characteristic New England apples for relatively high acidity, with additives to raise alcohol levels and contribute additional flavor notes._

## Overall Impression: 

Substantial body and character. Typically relatively dry, but can be somewhat sweet if in balance and not containing hot alcohol.

## Aroma/Flavor: 

A flavorful cider with robust apple character, strong alcohol, and derivative flavors from sugar additives; traditionally dry.

## Appearance: 

Clear to brilliant, pale to medium yellow.

## Mouthfeel: 

Substantial, alcoholic. Moderate tannin.

## Comments: 

Additives may include white and brown sugars, molasses, small amounts of honey, and raisins. Additives are intended to raise OG well above that which would be achieved by apples alone. This style is sometimes barrel-aged, in which case there will be oak character as with a barrel-aged wine. If the barrel was formerly used to age spirits, some flavor notes from the spirit (e.g., whisky or rum) may also be present, but must be subtle.
