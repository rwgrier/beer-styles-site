# C2B. Cider with Other Fruit

_This is a cider with other fruits or fruit-juices added – for example, berry. This is the correct style to enter a beverage fermented from a combination of apple and pear juice._

## Overall Impression: 

Like a white wine with complex flavors. The apple character must marry with the added fruit so that neither one dominates the other.

## Aroma/Flavor: 

The cider character must be present and must fit with the other fruits. It is a fault if the added fruit(s) completely dominate; a judge might ask, _Would this be different if neutral spirits replaced the cider?_ A fruit cider should not be like an alco-pop. Oxidation is a fault.

## Appearance: 

Clear to brilliant. Color appropriate to added fruit, but should not show oxidation characteristics. (For example, red berries should give red-to-purple color, not orange.)

## Mouthfeel: 

Substantial. May be significantly tannic, depending on fruit added.

## Entry Instructions: 

Entrants **MUST** specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants **MUST** specify sweetness (5 categories). Entrants **MUST** specify all fruit(s) and/or fruit juice(s) added.
