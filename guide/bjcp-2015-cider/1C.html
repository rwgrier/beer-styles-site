<h1>C1C. French Cider</h1>

<p><em><strong>French Cider</strong> includes Normandy styles plus ciders inspired by those styles, including ciders made by various techniques to achieve the French flavor profile. These ciders are made with bittersweet and bitter-sharp apple varieties cultivated specifically for cider making.</em></p>

<p><em>Traditional French procedures use small amounts of salt and calcium compounds (calcium chloride, calcium carbonate) to aid the process of pectin coagulation. These compounds may be used, pre-fermentation, but in limited quantity. It is a fault if judges can detect a salty or chalky taste. The enzyme PME (pectin methyl esterase) may also be used pre-fermentation for pectin coagulation.</em></p>

<p><em>Note that the sweetness/gravity levels indicate an overall tendency, not a sharp delineation between English and French ciders.</em></p>

<h2>Overall Impression:</h2>

<p>Medium to sweet, full-bodied, rich.</p>

<h2>Aroma/Flavor:</h2>

<p>Fruity character/aroma. This may come from slow or arrested fermentation (in the French technique of <em>défécation</em>) or approximated by back-sweetening with juice. Tends to a rich fullness. MLF notes of spicy-smoky, phenolic, and farmyard are common but not required (just as with English style), and must not be pronounced. The French expect more subtle MLF character than do the English.</p>

<h2>Appearance:</h2>

<p>Clear to brilliant, medium yellow to amber color.</p>

<h2>Mouthfeel:</h2>

<p>Medium to full, mouth-filling. Moderate tannin, perceived mainly as astringency. Carbonation moderate to champagne-like, but at higher levels it must not gush or foam.</p>

<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>Typically made sweet to balance the tannin levels from the traditional apple varieties.</p>

<h2>Entry Instructions:</h2>

<p>Entrants <strong>MUST</strong> specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants <strong>MUST</strong> specify sweetness (medium to sweet only, 3 levels). Entrants <strong>MAY</strong> specify variety of apple for a single varietal cider; if specified, varietal character will be expected.</p>

<h2>Varieties:</h2>

<p>Nehou, Muscadet de Dieppe, Reine des Pommes, Michelin, etc.</p>

<h2>Vital Statistics:</h2>

<ul>
<li>OG:   1.050 - 1.065 </li>
<li>FG:   1.010 - 1.020</li>
<li>ABV:  3.0 - 6.0%</li>
</ul>
