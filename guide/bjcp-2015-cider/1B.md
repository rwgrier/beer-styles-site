# C1B. English Cider

_**English Cider** includes the English “West Country” plus ciders inspired by that style. These ciders are made with bittersweet and bitter-sharp apple varieties cultivated specifically for cider making. English ciders are traditionally fermented and aged in wood barrels, which adds some character; however, the barrels used are rarely new, so there is no overt wood character._

## Overall Impression: 

Generally dry, full-bodied, austere. Complex flavor profile, long finish.

## Aroma/Flavor: 

No overt apple character, but various flavors and esters that suggest apples, particularly tannic varieties. English-style ciders commonly go through MLF (see _Introduction/Aroma-and-Flavor_) which produces desirable spicy/smoky, phenolic, and farmyard/old-horse characters. These flavor notes are positive but **not** required. If present, they must not dominate; in particular, the phenolic and farmyard notes should not be heavy. A strong farmyard character without spicy/smoky or phenolic suggests a _Brettanomyces_ contamination, which is a fault. Mousiness is a serious fault.

## Appearance: 

Barely cloudy to brilliant. Medium yellow to amber color.

## Mouthfeel: 

Full. Moderate to high tannin, perceived as astringency and some bitterness. Carbonation still to moderate. Bottle-fermented or -conditioned ciders may have high carbonation, up to champagne levels, but not gushing or foaming.

## Comments: 

Sweet examples exist, but dry is most traditional, particularly when considering the drying contributions of tannin.

## Entry Instructions: 

Entrants **MUST** specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants **MUST** specify sweetness (dry through medium-sweet, 4 levels). Entrants **MAY** specify variety of apple for a single varietal cider; if specified, varietal character will be expected.
