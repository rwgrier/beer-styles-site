# C1D. New World Perry

_**New World Perry** is made from culinary/table pears._

## Overall Impression: 

Mild. Medium to medium-sweet. Still to lightly sparkling. Only very slight acetification is acceptable. Mousiness, ropy/oily characters are serious faults.

## Aroma/Flavor: 

There is a pear character, but not obviously fruity. It tends toward that of a young white wine. No bitterness.

## Appearance: 

Slightly cloudy to clear. Generally quite pale.

## Mouthfeel: 

Relatively full, low to moderate tannin apparent as astringency.

## Comments: 

_Some_ table pears may contain significant amounts of sorbitol, in which case a _dry_ perry may give an impression of sweetness due to sorbitol in the pears. Perception of sorbitol as _sweet_ is highly variable from one person to the next. Hence, entrants should specify sweetness according to actual residual sugar amount, and judges must be aware that they might perceive more sweetness than how the perry was entered.
