# C2D. Ice Cider

_This is a cider style in which the juice is concentrated before fermentation either by freezing fruit before pressing or freezing juice and removing water. Fermentation stops or is arrested before reaching dryness. The character differs from Applewine in that the ice cider process increases not only sugar (hence alcohol) but acidity and all fruit flavor components proportionately. No additives are permitted in this style; in particular, sweeteners may not be used to increase gravity. This style originated in Quebec in the 1990s._

## Aroma/Flavor: 

Fruity, smooth, sweet-tart. Acidity must be enough to prevent it being cloying.

## Appearance: 

Brilliant. Color is deeper than a standard cider, gold to amber.

## Mouthfeel: 

Full body. May be tannic (astringent and/or bitter) but this should be slight, to moderate at most.
