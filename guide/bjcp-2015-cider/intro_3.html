<h1>Appearance</h1>

<ul>
<li>Clarity may vary from good to brilliant. The lack of sparkling clarity is not a fault, but visible particles are undesirable. In some styles a “rustic” lack of brilliance is common. Perries are notoriously difficult to clear; as a result a slight haze is not a fault. However, a “sheen” in either cider or perry generally indicates the early stage of lactic contamination and is a distinct fault.</li>
<li>Carbonation may vary from entirely still to a champagne level. No or little carbonation is termed <strong>still</strong>. A still cider may give a slight <em>tickle on the tongue</em>. A moderate carbonation level is termed <strong>petillant</strong>. Highly carbonated is termed <strong>sparkling</strong>. At the higher levels of carbonation, the <em>mousse</em> (head) may be retained for a short time. However, gushing, foaming, and difficult-to-manage heads are faults.</li>
