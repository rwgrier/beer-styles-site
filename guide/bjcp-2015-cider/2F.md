# C2F. Specialty Cider/Perry

_This is an open-ended category for cider or perry with other ingredients such that it does not fit any of the categories above. This includes the use of other sweeteners. A cider with added honey may be entered here if the cider character remains dominant; otherwise it should be entered as mead in the cyser sub-category. Examples also include wood-fermented or aged ciders in which the wood/barrel character is a significant part of the overall flavor profile._

## Aroma/Flavor: 

The cider character must always be present, and must fit with added ingredients. If a spirit barrel was used, the character of the spirit (rum, whiskey, etc.) must be no more than just recognizable; it must not be a substantial element of the flavor.

## Appearance: 

Clear to brilliant. Color should be that of a standard cider unless other ingredients are expected to contribute color.

## Mouthfeel: 

Average body, may show tannic (astringent) or heavy body as determined by other ingredients.
