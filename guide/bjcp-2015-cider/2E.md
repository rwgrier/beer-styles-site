# C2E. Cider with Herbs/Spices

_This is a cider with any combination of “botanicals” added. Hopped ciders are included in this category. Other examples are ciders with “apple pie” spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice), ginger, lemon grass, herbal tea blends, etc._

## Overall Impression: 

Like a white wine with complex flavors. The apple character must marry with the botanicals and give a balanced result.

## Aroma/Flavor: 

The cider character must be present and must fit with the botanicals. As with a fruit cider, it is a fault if the botanicals dominate; a judge might ask, _Would this be different if neutral spirits replaced the cider?_ Oxidation of either the base cider or the additions is a fault.

## Appearance: 

Clear to brilliant. Color appropriate to added botanicals.

## Mouthfeel: 

Average or more. Cider may be tannic from effect of botanicals but must not be bitter from over-extraction.

## Entry Instructions: 

Entrants **MUST** specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants **MUST** specify sweetness (5 categories). Entrants **MUST** specify all botanicals added. If hops are used, entrant must specify variety/varieties used.
