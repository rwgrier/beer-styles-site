# C1A. New World Cider

_A **New World Cider** is made from culinary/table apples, with wild or crab apples often used for acidity/tannin balance. Compared to other styles in this category, these ciders are generally relatively lower in tannin and higher in acidity. “New World” references the style, not a location, as ciders in this style are also made in eastern England, Australia, Germany, etc._

## Overall Impression: 

A refreshing drink of some substance – not bland or watery. Sweet ciders must not be cloying. Dry ciders must not be too austere.

## Aroma/Flavor: 

Sweet or low-alcohol ciders may have apple aroma and flavor. Dry ciders will be more wine-like with some esters. Sugar and acidity should combine to give a refreshing character. Acidity is medium to high, refreshing, but must not be harsh or biting.

## Appearance:

Clear to brilliant, pale to medium gold in color.

## Mouthfeel:

Medium body. Some tannin should be present for slight to moderate astringency, but little bitterness.

## Comments:

An ideal cider serves well as a “session” drink, and suitably accompanies a wide variety of food.

## Entry Instructions:
