# C2C. Applewine

_The term for this category is traditional but possibly misleading: it is simply a cider with substantial added sugar to achieve higher alcohol than a standard cider. As such it comes closer to a white wine than any other style. No fruit other than apples may be used in this style._

## Overall Impression: 

Typically like a dry white wine, balanced, and with low astringency and bitterness.

## Aroma/Flavor: 

Comparable to a New World Cider. Cider character must be distinctive. Very dry to sweet, although often dry.

## Appearance: 

Clear to brilliant, pale to medium-gold. Cloudiness or hazes are inappropriate.

## Mouthfeel: 

Lighter than other ciders, because higher alcohol is derived from addition of sugar rather than juice. Carbonation may range from still to champagne-like.

## Entry Instructions: 

Entrants **MUST** specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants **MUST** specify sweetness (5 categories). 

## Vital Statistics:	
- OG:	1.045 - 1.070
