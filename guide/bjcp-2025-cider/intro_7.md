# Entry Instructions

- Carbonation and sweetness levels are constrained in some styles; other levels are considered out-of-style. If a style lists no restrictions, then all levels are allowable.
- Perceived carbonation is dependent on judging conditions, so specifying or requiring absolute volumes of CO2 is not necessary.
- Declaring fruit varieties is allowable in any style.
- Potential allergens must always be declared.
- Vital Statistics are general guidelines, not absolutes. Commercial outliers certainly exist.
