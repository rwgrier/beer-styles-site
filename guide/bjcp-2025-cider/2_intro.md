# C2. STRONG CIDER

_Strong Ciders use either sugary adjuncts or concentration processes to increase the final alcohol content to levels above those typically attainable from fermenting only unadulterated sweet cider. These additional ingredients or processes have noticeable effects on the finished profile of the ciders, in addition to simply increasing the alcohol level. The name of the category should not be interpreted as implying that every example is necessarily stronger in alcohol than every Traditional Cider style._

_The same general characteristics and fault descriptions apply to Strong Ciders as to Traditional Ciders (category C1), with the exception of allowable added ingredients. See the Introduction to Cider and Perry Styles for detailed sensory characteristics that apply to all styles._
