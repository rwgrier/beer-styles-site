# INTRODUCTION TO THE 2025 CIDER GUIDELINES

_The 2025 BJCP Cider Style Guidelines are a major rewrite of the 2015 edition. This document is a companion to the 2021 BJCP Beer Style Guidelines and the 2025 BJCP Mead Style Guidelines. While some of the 2015 content has been retained, there has been a reorganization and renaming of the categories and styles, including the addition of a few new styles._
