<h1>5D. German Pils</h1>

<h2>Overall Impression:</h2>

<p>A light-bodied, highly-attenuated, gold-colored, bottom-fermented bitter German beer showing excellent head retention and an elegant, floral hop aroma. Crisp, clean, and refreshing, a German Pils showcases the finest quality German malt and hops.</p>

<h2>Aroma:</h2>

<p>Medium-low to low grainy-sweet-rich malt character (often with a light honey and slightly toasted cracker quality) and distinctive flowery, spicy, or herbal hops. Clean fermentation profile. May optionally have a very light sulfury note that comes from water as much as yeast. The hops are moderately-low to moderately-high, but should not totally dominate the malt presence. One-dimensional examples are inferior to the more complex qualities when all ingredients are sensed. May have a very low background note of DMS.</p>

<h2>Appearance:</h2>

<p>Straw to light gold, brilliant to very clear, with a creamy, long-lasting white head.</p>

<h2>Flavor:</h2>

<p>Medium to high hop bitterness dominates the palate and lingers into the aftertaste. Moderate to moderately-low grainy-sweet malt character supports the hop bitterness. Low to high floral, spicy, or herbal hop flavor. Clean fermentation profile. Dry to medium-dry, crisp, well-attenuated finish with a bitter aftertaste and light malt flavor. Examples made with water with higher sulfate levels often will have a low sulfury flavor that accentuates the dryness and lengthens the finish; this is acceptable but not mandatory. Some versions have a soft finish with more of a malt flavor, but still with noticeable hop bitterness and flavor, with the balance still towards bitterness.</p>

<h2>Mouthfeel:</h2>

<p>Medium-light body. Medium to high carbonation.</p>

<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>Modern examples of Pils tend to become paler in color, drier in finish, and more bitter as you move from South to North in Germany, often mirroring the increase in sulfate in the water. The Pils found in Bavaria tend to be a bit softer in bitterness with more malt flavor and late hop character, yet still with sufficient hops and crispness of finish to differentiate itself from a Helles. The use of the term ‘Pils’ is more common in Germany than ‘Pilsner’ to differentiate it from the Czech style, and (some say) to show respect.</p>

<h2>History:</h2>

<p>Adapted from Czech Pilsner to suit brewing conditions in Germany, particularly water with higher mineral content and domestic hop varieties. First brewed in Germany in the early 1870s. Became more popular after WWII as German brewing schools emphasized modern techniques. Along with its sister beer, Czech Pilsner, is the ancestor of the most widely produced beer styles today. Average IBUs of many well-regarded commercial examples have dropped over time.</p>

<h2>Characteristic Ingredients:</h2>

<p>Continental Pilsner malt, German hop varieties (especially Saazer-type varieties such as Tettnanger, Hallertauer, and Spalt for taste and aroma; Saaz is less common), German lager yeast.</p>

<h2>Style Comparison:</h2>

<p>Lighter in body and color, drier, crisper, and more fully attenuated, with more of a lingering bitterness, and with higher carbonation than a Czech Premium Pale Lager. More hop character, malt flavor, and bitterness than International Pale Lagers. More hop character and bitterness with a drier, crisper finish than a Munich Helles; the Helles has more malt flavor, but of the same character as the Pils.</p>

<h2>Vital Statistics:</h2>

<ul>
<li>OG:   1.044 – 1.050</li>
<li>FG:   1.008 – 1.013</li>
<li>IBUs: 22 – 40 </li>
<li>SRM:  2 – 5<br></li>
<li>ABV:  4.4 – 5.2%</li>
</ul>

<h2>Commercial Examples:</h2>

<p>K&ouml;nig Pilsener, Left Hand Polestar Pils, Paulaner Premium Pils, Sch&ouml;nramer Pils, Stoudt Pils, Tr&ouml;egs Sunshine Pils, Trumer Pils</p>
