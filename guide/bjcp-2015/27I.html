<h1>Historical Beer: Sahti</h1>

<h2>Overall Impression:</h2>

<p>A sweet, heavy, strong traditional Finnish beer with a rye, juniper, and juniper berry flavor and a strong banana-clove yeast character.</p>

<h2>Aroma:</h2>

<p>High banana esters with moderate to moderately-high clove-like phenolics. Not sour. May have a low to moderate juniper character. Grainy malt, caramel, and rye in background. Light alcohol aroma. Sweet malt impression.</p>

<h2>Appearance:</h2>

<p>Pale yellow to dark brown color; most are medium to dark amber. Generally quite cloudy (unfiltered). Little head, due to low carbonation.</p>

<h2>Flavor:</h2>

<p>Strong banana and moderate to moderately-high clove yeast character. Moderate grainy rye flavor. Low bitterness. Fairly sweet finish. Juniper can add a pine-like flavor; juniper berries can add a gin-like flavor; both should be complementary, not dominant. No noticeable hop flavor. Moderate caramel flavor but no roast. Multi-layered and complex, with kind of a wortiness that is unusual in other beer styles. Not sour.</p>

<h2>Mouthfeel:</h2>

<p>Thick, viscous, and heavy with protein (no boil means no hot break). Nearly still to medium-low carbonation. Strongly warming from the alcohol level and young age, but often masked by sweetness.</p>

<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>The use of rye doesn’t mean that it should taste like caraway (a dominant flavor in rye bread). The use of juniper berries will give a flavor like gin (similarly flavored with juniper berries). The juniper acts a bit like hops in the balance and flavor, providing some counterpoint to the sweet malt.</p>

<h2>History:</h2>

<p>An indigenous traditional style from Finland; a farmhouse tradition for at least 500 years, often brewed for festive occasions like summer weddings, and consumed within a week or two of brewing. A similar tradition exists in Estonia, where the beer is known as <em>koduolu</em>.</p>

<h2>Characteristic Ingredients:</h2>

<p>Malted barley along with malted and unmalted grains, often rye. Low hops. Juniper boughs used for lautering (traditionally in a hollowed-out log), but often producing a juniper/berry character. Often uses top-fermenting baker’s yeast in a fast, warm fermentation (German Weizen yeast is a good substitute). Not boiled; a long mash steep is used, with a separately added hop tea.</p>

<h2>Style Comparison:</h2>

<p>Strong resemblance to Weizenbocks, but sweet and thick with a rye and juniper character.</p>

<h2>Vital Statistics:</h2>

<ul>
<li>OG:   1.076 – 1.120</li>
<li>FG:   1.016 – 1.020</li>
<li>IBUs: 7 – 15<br></li>
<li>SRM:  4 – 22<br></li>
<li>ABV:  7.0 – 11.0%</li>
</ul>

<h2>Commercial examples:</h2>

<p>Now made year-round by several breweries in Finland.</p>
