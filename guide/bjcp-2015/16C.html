<h1>16C. Tropical Stout</h1>

<h2>Overall Impression:</h2>

<p>A very dark, sweet, fruity, moderately strong ale with smooth roasty flavors without a burnt harshness.</p>

<h2>Aroma:</h2>

<p>Sweetness evident, moderate to high intensity. Roasted grain aromas moderate to high, and can have coffee or chocolate notes. Fruitiness medium to high. May have a molasses, licorice, dried fruit, and/or vinous aromatics. Stronger versions can have a subtle clean aroma of alcohol. Hop aroma low to none. Diacetyl low to none.</p>

<h2>Appearance:</h2>

<p>Very deep brown to black in color. Clarity usually obscured by deep color (if not opaque, should be clear). Large tan to brown head with good retention.</p>

<h2>Flavor:</h2>

<p>Quite sweet with a smooth dark grain flavors, and restrained bitterness. Roasted grain and malt character can be moderate to high with a smooth coffee or chocolate flavor, although the roast character is moderated in the balance by the sweet finish. Moderate to high fruity esters. Can have a sweet, dark rum-like quality. Little to no hop flavor. Medium-low to no diacetyl.</p>

<h2>Mouthfeel:</h2>

<p>Medium-full to full body, often with a smooth, creamy character. May give a warming (but never hot) impression from alcohol presence. Moderate to moderately-high carbonation.</p>

<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>Sweetness levels can vary significantly. Surprisingly refreshing in a hot climate.</p>

<h2>History:</h2>

<p>Originally high-gravity stouts brewed for tropical markets, became popular and imitated by local brewers often using local sugars and ingredients.</p>

<h2>Characteristic Ingredients:</h2>

<p>Similar to a sweet stout, but with more gravity. Pale and dark roasted malts and grains. Hops mostly for bitterness. May use adjuncts and sugar to boost gravity. Typically made with warm-fermented lager yeast.</p>

<h2>Style Comparison:</h2>

<p>Tastes like a scaled-up sweet stout with higher fruitiness. Similar to some Imperial Stouts without the high bitterness, strong/burnt roastiness, and late hops, and with lower alcohol. Much more sweet and less hoppy than American Stouts. Much sweeter and less bitter than the similar-gravity Export Stouts.</p>
