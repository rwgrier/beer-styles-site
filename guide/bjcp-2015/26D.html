<h1>26D. Belgian Dark Strong Ale</h1>

<h2>Overall Impression:</h2>

<p>A dark, complex, very strong Belgian ale with a delicious blend of malt richness, dark fruit flavors, and spicy elements. Complex, rich, smooth and dangerous.</p>

<h2>Aroma:</h2>

<p>Complex, with a rich-sweet malty presence, significant esters and alcohol, and an optional light to moderate spiciness. The malt is rich and strong, and can have a deep bready-toasty quality often with a deep caramel complexity. The fruity esters are strong to moderately low, and can contain raisin, plum, dried cherry, fig or prune notes. Spicy phenols may be present, but usually have a peppery quality not clove-like; light vanilla is possible. Alcohols are soft, spicy, perfumy and/or rose-like, and are low to moderate in intensity. Hops are not usually present (but a very low spicy, floral, or herbal hop aroma is acceptable). No dark/roast malt aroma. No hot alcohols or solventy aromas.</p>

<h2>Appearance:</h2>

<p>Deep amber to deep coppery-brown in color (<em>dark</em> in this context implies <em>more deeply colored than golden</em>). Huge, dense, moussy, persistent cream- to light tan-colored head. Can be clear to somewhat hazy.</p>

<h2>Flavor:</h2>

<p>Similar to aroma (same malt, ester, phenol, alcohol, and hop comments apply to flavor as well). Moderately malty-rich on the palate, which can have a sweet impression if bitterness is low. Usually moderately dry to dry finish, although may be up to moderately sweet. Medium-low to moderate bitterness; alcohol provides some of the balance to the malt. Generally malty-rich balance, but can be fairly even with bitterness. The complex and varied flavors should blend smoothly and harmoniously. The finish should not be heavy or syrupy.</p>

<h2>Mouthfeel:</h2>

<p>High carbonation but not sharp. Smooth but noticeable alcohol warmth. Body can range from medium-light to medium-full and creamy. Most are medium-bodied.</p>

<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>Authentic Trappist versions tend to be drier (Belgians would say <em>more digestible</em>) than Abbey versions, which can be rather sweet and full-bodied. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (or <em>refermented in the bottle</em>). Sometimes known as a Trappist Quadruple, most are simply known by their strength or color designation.</p>

<h2>History:</h2>

<p>Most versions are unique in character reflecting characteristics of individual breweries, produced in limited quantities and often highly sought-after.</p>

<h2>Characteristic Ingredients:</h2>

<p>Belgian yeast strains prone to production of higher alcohols, esters, and sometimes phenolics are commonly used. Impression of a complex grain bill, although many traditional versions are quite simple, with caramelized sugar syrup or unrefined sugars and yeast providing much of the complexity. Saazer-type, English-type or Styrian Goldings hops commonly used. Spices generally not used; if used, keep subtle and in the background. </p>

<h2>Style Comparison:</h2>

<p>Like a larger dubbel, with a fuller body and increased malt richness. Not as bitter or hoppy as a tripel, but of similar strength.</p>

<h2>Vital Statistics:</h2>

<ul>
<li>OG:   1.075 – 1.110</li>
<li>FG:   1.010 – 1.024</li>
<li>IBUs: 20 – 35 </li>
<li>SRM:  12 – 22 </li>
<li>ABV:  8.0 – 12.0%</li>
</ul>

<h2>Commercial Examples:</h2>

<p>Achel Extra Brune, Boulevard The Sixth Glass, Chimay Grande Réserve, Gouden Carolus Grand Cru of the Emperor, Rochefort 8 &amp; 10, St. Bernardus Abt 12, Westvleteren 12</p>
