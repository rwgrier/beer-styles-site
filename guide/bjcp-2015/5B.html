<h1>5B. K&ouml;lsch</h1>

<h2>Overall Impression:</h2>

<p>A clean, crisp, delicately-balanced beer usually with a very subtle fruit and hop character. Subdued maltiness throughout leads into a pleasantly well-attenuated and refreshing finish. Freshness makes a huge difference with this beer, as the delicate character can fade quickly with age. Brilliant clarity is characteristic.</p>

<h2>Aroma:</h2>

<p>Low to very low malt aroma, with a grainy-sweet character. A pleasant, subtle fruit aroma from fermentation (apple, cherry or pear) is acceptable, but not always present. A low floral, spicy or herbal hop aroma is optional but not out of style. Some yeast strains may give a slight winy or sulfury character (this characteristic is also optional, but not a fault). Overall, the intensity of aromatics is fairly subtle but generally balanced, clean, and fresh.</p>

<h2>Appearance:</h2>

<p>Very pale gold to light gold. Very clear (authentic commercial versions are filtered to a brilliant clarity). Has a delicate white head that may not persist.</p>

<h2>Flavor:</h2>

<p>Soft, rounded palate comprised of a delicate flavor balance between soft yet attenuated malt, an almost imperceptible fruity sweetness from fermentation, and a medium-low to medium bitterness with a delicate dryness and slight crispness in the finish (but no harsh aftertaste). The malt tends to be grainy-sweet, possibly with a very light bready or honey quality. The hop flavor is variable, and can range from low to moderately-high; most are medium-low to medium intensity and have a floral, spicy, or herbal character. May have a malty-sweet impression at the start, but this is not required. No noticeable residual sweetness. May have a slightly winy, minerally, or sulfury accent that accentuates the dryness and flavor balance. A slight wheat taste is rare but not a fault. Otherwise, very clean.</p>

<h2>Mouthfeel:</h2>

<p>Medium-light to medium body (most are medium-light). Medium to medium-high carbonation. Smooth and generally crisp and well-attenuated.</p>

<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>Characterized in Germany as a top-fermented, lagered beer. Each K&ouml;ln brewery produces a beer of different character, and each interprets the <em>K&ouml;lsch Konvention</em> slightly differently. Allow for a range of variation within the style when judging. Note that drier versions may seem hoppier or more bitter than the IBU specifications might suggest. Due to its delicate flavor profile, K&ouml;lsch tends to have a relatively short shelf-life; older examples and imports can easily show some oxidation defects. Served in K&ouml;ln in a tall, narrow 200ml glass called a <em>Stange</em>.</p>

<h2>History:</h2>

<p>Cologne, Germany (K&ouml;ln) has a top-fermenting brewing tradition since the Middle Ages, but developed the beer now known as K&ouml;lsch in the late 1800s to combat encroaching bottom-fermented pale lagers. K&ouml;lsch is an appellation protected by the <em>K&ouml;lsch Konvention</em> (1986), and is restricted to the 20 or so breweries in and around K&ouml;ln. The <em>Konvention</em> simply defines the beer as a “light, highly attenuated, hop-accentuated, clear, top-fermenting <em>Vollbier</em>.” </p>

<h2>Characteristic Ingredients:</h2>

<p>Traditional German hops (Hallertau, Tettnang, Spalt or Hersbrucker). German Pils or pale malt. Attenuative, clean ale yeast. Up to 20% wheat malt may be used, but this is quite rare in authentic versions. Current commercial practice is to ferment warm, cold condition for a short period of time, and serve young.</p>

<h2>Style Comparison:</h2>

<p>To the untrained taster, easily mistaken for a cream ale or somewhat subtle Pils.</p>

<h2>Vital Statistics:</h2>

<li>OG:   1.044 – 1.050</li>
