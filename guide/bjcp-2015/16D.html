<h1>16D. Foreign Extra Stout</h1>

<h2>Overall Impression:</h2>

<p>A very dark, moderately strong, fairly dry, stout with prominent roast flavors.</p>

<h2>Aroma:</h2>

<p>Moderate to high roasted grain aromas, often with coffee, chocolate and/or lightly burnt notes. Low to medium fruitiness. May have a sweet aroma, or molasses, licorice, dried fruit, and/or vinous aromatics. Stronger versions can have a subtle, clean aroma of alcohol. Hop aroma moderately low to none, can be earthy, herbal or floral. Diacetyl low to none.</p>

<h2>Appearance:</h2>

<p>Very deep brown to black in color. Clarity usually obscured by deep color (if not opaque, should be clear). Large tan to brown head with good retention.</p>

<h2>Flavor:</h2>

<p>Moderate to high roasted grain and malt flavor with a coffee, chocolate, or lightly burnt grain character, although without a sharp bite. Moderately dry. Low to medium esters. Medium to high bitterness. Moderate to no hop flavor, can be earthy, herbal, or floral. Diacetyl medium-low to none.</p>

<h2>Mouthfeel:</h2>

<p>Medium-full to full body, often with a smooth, sometimes creamy character. May give a warming (but never hot) impression from alcohol presence. Moderate to moderately-high carbonation.</p>

<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>Also known as Foreign Stout, Export Stout, Foreign Export Stout. Historic versions (before WWI, at least) had the same OG as domestic Extra Stouts, but had a higher ABV because it had a long secondary with Brettanomyces chewing away at it. The difference between domestic and foreign versions were the hopping and length of maturation. </p>

<h2>History:</h2>

<p>Stronger stouts brewed for the export market today, but with a history stretching back to the 18th and 19th centuries when they were more heavily-hopped versions of stronger export stouts. Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (originally, West India Porter, later Foreign Extra Double Stout) was first brewed in 1801 according to Guinness with “extra hops to give it a distinctive taste and a longer shelf life in hot weather, this is brewed [today] in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. It [currently] makes up 40% of all the Guinness brewed around the world.” </p>

<h2>Characteristic Ingredients:</h2>

<p>Pale and dark roasted malts and grains, historically also could have used brown and amber malts. Hops mostly for bitterness, typically English varieties. May use adjuncts and sugar to boost gravity.</p>

<h2>Style Comparison:</h2>

<p>Similar in balance to an Irish Extra Stout, but with more alcohol. Not as big or intense as a Russian Imperial Stout. Lacking the strong bitterness and high late hops of American Stouts. Similar gravity as Tropical Stout, but with a drier finish, higher bitterness, and less esters.</p>

<h2>Vital Statistics:</h2>

<ul>
<li>OG:   1.056 – 1.075</li>
<li>FG:   1.010 – 1.018</li>
<li>IBUs: 50 – 70   </li>
<li>SRM:  30 – 40   </li>
<li>ABV:  6.3 – 8.0%</li>
</ul>
