# APPENDIX B: LOCAL STYLES

_This appendix contains styles submitted by local chapters of the BJCP for styles that are not yet established, but are more important for homebrewers within a single country. They are not included in the main style guidelines, but are available for use by those who wish to use them. The guidelines were written by local members, and were not validated by the BJCP._
