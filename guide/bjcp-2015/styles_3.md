# Common Attributes of All Beer Styles

The attributes discussed in this section are assumed to be present in every beer style description unless otherwise noted. It is not necessary to repeat all these characteristics for every style description. _Do not assume that since a characteristic (such as diacetyl) isn’t mentioned in a style description that somehow it is allowable._

**_Unless explicitly noted in an individual style description_**, all beer styles are assumed to be cleanly fermented and free from technical faults, including acetaldehyde, astringency, chlorophenols, diacetyl, DMS, fusel alcohol, and phenolics. All beer styles are assumed to be free of packaging and handling faults, including oxidation, light-struck, sour, and musty characteristics. 

In mouthfeel, all beers are assumed to be free from astringency, and not be creamy or have any other palate sensations unless otherwise noted. Beers with an alcohol level of 6% or less are assumed to not have the flavor or warming nature of alcohol, unless otherwise noted. Higher-alcohol beers that have a noticeable alcohol presence should not be harsh, hot, solventy, or burning. The alcohol character if noted, should be clean and not have fusel alcohols.

Lagers tend to be smooth, clean, and free of esters, but may have slight yeast-derived sulfur notes that are often fleeting. Styles made with a large amount of Pilsner malt may have low DMS notes; this is not a fault, but it is also not required unless otherwise noted. In both cases, the small amounts of sulfur and/or DMS should not be taken as meaning that prominent quantities are somehow desirable - they’re not. Just be aware that the use of some traditional ingredients often leave small sensory indications of their presence that might be considered faults in other contexts; that is perfectly acceptable, although not required. 

Unless otherwise noted, assume all lagers to not have any fruitiness (esters). Ales tend to be less smooth than lagers, so unless otherwise noted, assume all ales may have some esters (not required, but not a fault).
