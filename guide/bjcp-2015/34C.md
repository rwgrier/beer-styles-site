# 34C. Experimental Beer

_This is explicitly a catch-all category for any beer that does not fit into an existing style description. No beer is ever “out of style” in this style, unless it fits elsewhere. This is the last resort for any beer entered into a competition._

## Overall Impression: 

Varies, but should be a unique experience.

## Aroma: 

Varies.

## Appearance: 

Varies.

## Flavor: 

Varies.

## Mouthfeel: 

Varies.

## Comments: 

This style is the ultimate in creativity, since it cannot represent a well-known commercial beer (otherwise it would be a clone beer) and cannot fit into any other existing Specialty-Type style (including those within this major category).

## Entry Instructions: 

The entrant **must** specify the special nature of the experimental beer, including the special ingredients or processes that make it not fit elsewhere in the guidelines. The entrant **must** provide vital statistics for the beer, **and** either a brief sensory description or a list of ingredients used in making the beer. _Without this information, judges will have no basis for comparison._

## Vital Statistics: 

OG, FG, IBUs, SRM and ABV will vary depending on the declared beer.

## Commercial Examples: 

None
