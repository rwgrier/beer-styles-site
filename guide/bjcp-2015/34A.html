<h1>34A. Clone Beer</h1>

<p><em>This style is intended for reproductions of specific commercial beers that aren’t good representations of existing styles. The use of the word clone does <strong>not</strong> imply an exact copy; it implies an interpretation of a style represented by a specific beer that does not have a defined style within the guidelines. The beer should be judged as to how well it fits the broader style represented by the example beer, not how well it is an exact copy of a specific commercial product. If a ‘clone beer’ does fit another style, do not enter it here.</em></p>

<h2>Comments:</h2>

<h2>Entry Instructions:</h2>

<p>The entrant <strong>must</strong> specify the name of the commercial beer being cloned, specifications (vital statistics) for the beer, and either a brief sensory description or a list of ingredients used in making the beer. <em>Without this information, judges who are unfamiliar with the beer will have no basis for comparison.</em></p>

<h2>Vital Statistics:</h2>

<p>OG, FG, IBUs, SRM and ABV will vary depending on the declared beer.</p>
