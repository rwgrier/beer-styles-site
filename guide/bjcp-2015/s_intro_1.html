<h1>INTRODUCTION TO SPECIALTY-TYPE BEER</h1>

<p><em><strong>Specialty-Type Beer</strong> is a broad term used to refer to the styles described in Categories 28 through 34. They are different from what we call <strong>Classic Styles</strong> that are represented by Categories 1 through 27. The Classic Styles stand alone and can be fully described in a standard BJCP style description. Specialty-Type Beers involve some form of transformation of either a Classic Style or another base beer, either though adding additional ingredients, or handling the beer differently using an alternative process. The Specialty-Type Beer style descriptions cannot completely describe a style on their own, as Classic Style write-ups do. Rather, the Specialty-Type Beer style descriptions discuss how the additional ingredient or process affects the base beer style.</em></p>

<p><em>This introduction section is assumed to be part of every Specialty-Type Beer style. It describes in general how to enter and judge a Specialty-Type Beer. Specific instructions for a style will be contained within the individual guidelines.</em></p>

<p><em>In general, when submitting a Specialty-Type Beer with a food-type ingredient, keep in mind that we use the culinary definition of ingredients rather than the botanical definition of ingredients. Look for the detailed lists of ingredients in the style category descriptions rather than making an assumption.</em></p>
