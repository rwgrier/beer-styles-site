<h1>Breslau-Style Schoeps</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Straw to black</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Hue may be too dark to perceive clarity in some versions.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Malt sweetness is medium to medium-high with a pronounced malt character. A high proportion of pale or dark wheat malt (as much as 80 percent) is used to brew these beers as well as Pilsener and other pale, toasted or dark specialty malts. Paler versions may have bready, aromatic biscuit malt attributes. Darker versions may exhibit roast malt bitterness at low levels, and toasted or nutty malt attributes. Caramel-like malt attributes are not present.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Very low</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Medium-low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Fruity esters may be present as these beers are fermented with ale yeast as opposed to wheat beer yeast. Diacetyl and phenolic aromas and flavors should not be present.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Full</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Traditional German wheat beer yeast is not used in this style of beer. <em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, competition organizers may choose to create subcategories which reflect pale and dark versions.</em></li>
</ul>
