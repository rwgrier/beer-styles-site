# German-Style Leichtes Weizen

- **Color:** Straw to copper-amber
- **Clarity:** If served with yeast, appearance may be very cloudy.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Very low to medium-low
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not present to very low
- **Perceived bitterness:** Very low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** The phenolic and estery aromas typical of Weissbiers should be present but less pronounced in this style. The overall flavor profile is less complex than Hefeweizen due to a lower alcohol content and there is less yeasty flavor. Diacetyl should not be present.
- **Body:** Low with a lighter mouthfeel than Hefeweizen. The German word “leicht” means light, and as such these beers are light versions of Hefeweizen.
- **Additional notes:** These beers are made with at least 50 percent wheat malt. They are often roused during pouring, and when yeast is present, they will have a yeasty flavor and a fuller mouthfeel.
