<h1>German-Style Rye Ale</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Pale to very dark, with darker versions ranging from dark amber to dark brown.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Chill haze is acceptable in versions packaged and served without yeast. In versions served with yeast, appearance may range from hazy to very cloudy.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> In darker versions, malt aromas and flavors can optionally include low roasted malt characters expressed as cocoa/chocolate or caramel, and/or aromatic toffee, caramel, or biscuit attributes. Malt sweetness can vary from low to medium. Low level of roast malt astringency is acceptable when balanced with low to medium malt sweetness.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Not present</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Very low to low</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Low to medium banana–like and/or other fruity ester aromas and flavors are typical. Clove-like and/or other phenolic aromas and flavors should also be present. No yeast aroma should be present in versions without yeast. Versions packaged and served without yeast will not have yeast flavor or full mouthfeel typical of beers with yeast. Versions with yeast will have low to medium yeast aroma and flavor and a full mouthfeel, but the yeast character should not overpower the balance of rye and barley malts, esters and phenolics.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Grist should include at least 30 percent rye malt. Versions with yeast are often roused during pouring. When yeast is present, the beer should have a yeasty flavor and a fuller mouthfeel.</li>
</ul>
