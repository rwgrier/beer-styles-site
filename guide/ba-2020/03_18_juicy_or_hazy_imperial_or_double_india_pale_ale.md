# Juicy or Hazy Imperial or Double India Pale Ale

- **Color:** Straw to light amber
- **Clarity:** Low to very high degree of cloudiness is typical of these beers. Starch, yeast, hop, protein and/or other compounds contribute to a wide range of hazy appearance within this category.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Low to high malt aroma and flavor may be present
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** High to very high hop aroma and flavor are present, with attributes typical of hops from any origin.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low to medium. The impression of bitterness is soft and well-integrated into overall balance, and may differ significantly from measured or calculated IBU levels.
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Medium-high to high fruity esters are present, and can contribute to the perception of sweetness and be complementary to the hop profile. Diacetyl should not be present.
- **Body:** Medium to high. A silky or full mouthfeel may contribute to overall flavor profile.
- **Additional notes:** Grist may include oats, wheat or other adjuncts to promote haziness. The term "juicy" is frequently used to describe taste and aroma hop- derived attributes often present in these beers which result from late, often very large, additions of hops. A juicy character is not required, however. Other hop- derived attributes such as citrus, pine, spice, floral or others may be present with or without the presence of juicy attributes. Versions of this style brewed with darker malts, non-traditional ale yeasts, fruits, spices or other flavorings are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ales.
