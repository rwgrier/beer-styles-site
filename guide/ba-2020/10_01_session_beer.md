# Session Beer

- **Color:** The color should mimic the classic style upon which the beer is based
- **Clarity:** Appearance may vary from brilliant to hazy to cloudy and should mimic the classic style upon which the beer is based
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Malt attributes should mimic the classic style upon which the beer is based, but at lower overall intensity due to lower original gravity.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Hop attributes should mimic the classic style upon which the beer is based, but at lower overall intensity in order to maintain the balance typical of that style.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Should mimic the classic style upon which the beer is based, but at lower overall intensity in order to maintain the balance typical of that style.
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Varies with underlying style
- **Body:** Varies with underlying style
- **Additional notes:** This category includes beers of any style that 1) are at or below 5.0% abv (4.0% abw), and 2) have an original gravity and alcohol content below the range of the classic style as defined in these guidelines. These beers exhibit lower original gravity and alcohol content than the classic style. Drinkability is key to a successful session beer. Beers at or below 5.0% abv (4% abw) that adhere to the specifications of a classic style are not categorized as Session Beers. For example, low gravity beers such as Belgian-Style Table Beers or English-Style Mild Ales should be categorized within their appropriate categories. Drinkability is key to a successful session beer. _When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, organizers may wish to further subcategorize this category. Competition organizers may request that brewers provide actual percent alcohol by volume (abv) for their entries in this category._
