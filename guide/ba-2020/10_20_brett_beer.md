# Brett Beer

- **Color:** Any color is acceptable. Beer color may be influenced by the color of added fruits or other ingredients.
- **Clarity:** Chill haze and/or haze from yeast is allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel and chocolate aromas and flavors are present at low levels.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Low to high
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low to high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Medium to high fruity esters are present. Acidity resulting from _Brettanomyces_ fermentation results in a complex flavor profile. _Brettanomyces_ character, at low to high levels, should be present and expressed as horsey, goaty, leathery, phenolic, fruity and/or acidic aromas and flavors. _Brettanomyces_ character may or may not be dominant. Acidity from _Brettanomyces_ should be low to medium-low. Cultured yeast strains may be used in the fermentation. Beers fermented with _Brettanomyces_ that do not exhibit attributes typical of _Brettanomyces_ fermentation are categorized elsewhere. Beers in this style should not incorporate bacteria or exhibit a bacteria-derived flavor profile. Diacetyl and DMS should not be present.
- **Body:** Low to high
- **Additional notes:** Fruited versions will exhibit fruit flavors in balance with other elements. Wood vessels may be used for fermentation and aging, but wood- derived flavors and aromas such as vanillin should not be present. Residual flavors and aromas originating from liquids previously aged in a barrel (bourbon, sherry, etc.) should not be present. Versions exhibiting attributes derived from wood or liquids previously aged in wood are categorized in Wood-Aged Beer categories. Sour wood- and barrel- aged versions are categorized in Wood-Aged Sour Beer categories. Entries exhibiting additional sensory attributes characteristic arising from microbes other than Brett are categorized as Mixed Culture Brett Beer. _When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as type of Brett(s) used, fruit(s) or other ingredients used or other factors which influence perceived sensory outcomes._
