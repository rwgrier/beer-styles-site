# American-Style Fruit Beer

- **Color:** Can range from pale to very dark depending on the underlying style and is often influenced by the color of added fruit
- **Clarity:** Clear or hazy is acceptable
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Not present to medium-low
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not present to medium-low
- **Perceived bitterness:** In balance with fruit character and usually at very low to medium levels
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** American-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional German, British or American ale or lager yeast. Beers fermented with Belgian-style, German-style Hefeweizen or other South German wheat beer or Berliner-style Weisse yeasts should be categorized elsewhere. Fruit beers exhibiting sourness should be categorized elsewhere. Attributes typical of wild fermentation should not be present.
- **Body:** Varies with style
- **Additional notes:** Fruit aromas, ranging from subtle to intense, should be present and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Fruit or fruit extracts, used as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, provide harmonious fruit character ranging from subtle to intense. Within the framework of these guidelines, fruit beers fermented with Belgian yeast (Wit, Abbey, Farmhouse, Saison and/or Brettanomyces) should be categorized as Belgian-Style Fruit Beers, or possibly as fruited Brett Beers. Some beers may fit into this category if they contain fruity adjuncts but no actual fruit. As an example, a juniper berry-flavored beer with notable juniper berry fruity flavor and/or aroma could be categorized as a Fruit Beer, whereas a beer in which the juniper berry character is more herbal or spicy should be categorized as an Herb and Spice Beer. Fruit Beers brewed with wheat should be categorized as Fruit Wheat Beers. Fruit Beers brewed with unusual fermentable(s), but no wheat, should be categorized as Fruit Beers. Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is defined as a vegetable, and beers containing coconut should be categorized as Field Beers. _When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as fruit(s) used or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes._
