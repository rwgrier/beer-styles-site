# American-Style India Pale Ale

- **Color:** Gold to copper
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Hop haze is allowable at any temperature.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Medium-low to medium intensity malt attributes are present in aroma and flavor
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** High, exhibiting floral, fruity (berry, tropical, stone fruit and other), sulfur, diesel-like, onion-garlic, catty, citrusy, piney or resinous character that was originally associated with American-variety hops. Hops with these attributes now also originate from countries other than the USA.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium-high to very high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity esters are low to high. Diacetyl and DMS should not be present.
- **Body:** Medium-low to medium
- **Additional notes:** The use of water with high mineral content may result in a crisp, dry beer rather than a malt-accentuated version. Sugar adjuncts may be used to enhance body and balance. Hops of varied origins may be used for bitterness or for approximating traditional American character. Versions of this style brewed with darker malts, non- traditional ale yeasts, fruits, spices or other flavorings are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ales.
