<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Pumpkin/Squash beers are any beers incorporating pumpkins (Cucurbita pepo) or winter squash as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation. Pumpkin or squash aromas and flavors, ranging from subtle to intense, should be present. These beers are not spiced, but may have flavors associated with other beer styles such as smoked beer, fruit beer, sour beer, etc. Spice aromas and flavors should be absent. Versions exhibiting spice aromas and/or flavors should be categorized as Pumpkin Spice Beers or as other spice beer or possibly as experimental beer styles.   <em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as pumpkin or squash used and related processing, or other factors which influence perceived sensory outcomes.</em></li>
