<h1>Herb and Spice Beer</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Varies depending on underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Clear to hazy is acceptable</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Varies depending on intention of brewer</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Not essential but may be present and may be more assertive than herb-spice character</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Very low to medium-low. Reduced hop bitterness tends to accentuate herb/spice character.</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Aromas and flavors of individual spices may not always be identifiable</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Varies with underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Herb and Spice beers are any beers using herbs or spices derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetables, flowers, etc. Herb and/or spice character can range from subtle to intense. Classifying these beers can be complex. Beers which exhibit herbal and/or spicy character are considered Herb and Spice Beers. Beers brewed with chili peppers are categorized as Chili Pepper Beers. Beers brewed with pumpkin in which herb and spice character dominates should be categorized as Pumpkin Spice Beers. <em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as type or form of herb(s) or spice(s) used or other factors which influence perceived sensory outcomes.</em></li>
</ul>
