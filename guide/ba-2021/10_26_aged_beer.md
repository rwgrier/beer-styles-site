- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Aged Beers are any beers aged for over one year. A brewer may brew any type of beer of any strength and enhance its character with various aging conditions for an extended time. In general, beers with high hopping rates, roast malt, high alcohol content, and/or complex herbal, smoke or fruit character are the best candidates for aging. Aged Beers may be aged in bottles, cans, kegs or other non-wooden vessels. Aged character may be expressed in mouthfeel, aroma and flavor. Often, aged character is the result of oxidative reactions that either bring individual flavor components into harmony or are unique flavors unto themselves. Sherry-like and fruity flavors often develop during aging, and hop character often changes. No matter what the effect, the overall character should be balanced and without aggressive flavors. The level of change created by aging will vary with the duration of aging and the underlying beer style. Mildly-flavored beers are more likely to develop aggressive and unpleasant oxidation. Positive transformations are more likely to occur in beers with higher levels of hops, malt and/or alcohol.

- **Additional notes:** Within the framework of these guidelines, various Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beers which then undergo aging of one or more years in glass or stainless, and, which clearly exhibit sensory outcomes of that additional aging, may be categorized as Aged Beers. However, Brett Beers, Sour Beers or any other beers exhibiting attributes of aging in the presence of any microflora must be categorized elsewhere. Beers which have undergone aging but which nonetheless do not display characteristics of aging are categorized within their base styles.<br/>
_When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as length of time aged, type of vessel, duration of aging process, other ingredients or other processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes._
