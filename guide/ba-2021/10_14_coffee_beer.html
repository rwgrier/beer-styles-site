<h1>Coffee Beer</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Pale to black depending on the underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Clear to hazy is acceptable</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Medium-low to medium malt sweetness provides balance with coffee flavor and aroma</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Low to high depending on the underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Varies with underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Typical of underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Reï¬‚ective of the underlying beer style</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Coffee beers incorporate coffee in any form. Coffee character should be apparent as the defining attribute of this category, ranging from subtle to intense, and should be in harmony with other attributes of the underlying beer. Other flavors arising from the use of flavored coffee may also be present. <br/>
<em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, competition organizers may create categories which reflect groups of coffee beers based on underlying beer style or other factors. Brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as type or form of coffee used or other factors which influence perceived sensory outcomes.</em></li>
</ul>
