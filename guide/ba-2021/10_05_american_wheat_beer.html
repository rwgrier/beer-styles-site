<h1>American-Style Wheat Beer</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Straw to dark brown</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Clear to cloudy</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Low to medium-low level pale malt attributes are present in paler versions. Medium-low to medium-high malt attributes such as cocoa, chocolate, caramel, toffee, or biscuit may be present in darker versions. Roast malt astringency is acceptable in darker versions when balanced with malt sweetness.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Low to medium-high</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Low to medium fruity esters are present. Diacetyl and phenolic, clove-like attributes should not be present. Low to medium yeast character is present in versions served with yeast, in harmony with malt and hop attributes and not sharp.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Very low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> These beers can be fermented with either ale or lager yeast. The grist should include at least 30 percent malted wheat. Versions served with yeast may exhibit somewhat higher perceived bitterness and fuller mouthfeel. <br/>
<em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, organizers may wish to further subcategorize this category based on the presence or absence of yeast, use of darker malts, etc.</em></li>
</ul>
