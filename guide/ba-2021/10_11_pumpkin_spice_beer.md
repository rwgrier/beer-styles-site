# Pumpkin Spice Beer

- **Color:** Can vary from pale to very dark depending on the underlying style
- **Clarity:** Clear to hazy is acceptable
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Can vary from low to medium-high depending on the underlying style
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** None to medium and should not overpower spice, pumpkin or squash, if present, or overall balance of aromas and flavors.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low to medium-low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Typical of underlying beer style
- **Body:** Varies with underlying style
- **Additional notes:** These are any beers using pumpkins (_Cucurbita pepo_) or winter squash as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation. Pumpkin or squash may not be present or may range from subtle to intense. They are spiced with other ingredients whose character should be present and in balance. While cinnamon, allspice, clove, and nutmeg are common spices added to American-type pumpkin beers, other spices may be used. For example, a brewer could replicate a Wit-Pumpkin spiced beer by using orange peel and coriander. <br/>
