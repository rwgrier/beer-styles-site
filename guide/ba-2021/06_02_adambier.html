<h1>Adambier</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Light brown to very dark</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Beer color may be too dark to perceive clarity. When clarity is perceivable, chill haze is absent.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Toast and caramel malt aroma and flavor may be present. Astringency from highly roasted malt should not be present.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Low, with attributes typical of traditional non-hybrid European hop varieties.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> A cool ale fermentation is typically used. Extensive aging and acidification of this beer can mask malt and hop character to varying degrees. Aging in barrels may contribute some level of <em>Brettanomyces</em> and lactic character.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Medium to full</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> The style originated in Dortmund and is a strong, dark, hoppy ale which may or may not be sour. It may also be extensively aged in wooden barrels. Traditional versions may have a low or medium-low degree of smokiness. Adambier may or may not use wheat in its formulation. Smoke character may be absent in contemporary versions. Fruited versions of this style which exhibit attributes of wood-aging should be categorized as fruited Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beers. Fruited versions of this style which do not exhibit attributes of wood- aging should be categorized as Fruit Wheat Beers.</li>
</ul>
