# Rye Beer

- **Color:** A wide range of color is acceptable. Lighter versions are straw to copper, while darker versions are dark amber to dark brown.
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable in versions packaged and served without yeast. In versions served with yeast, appearance may range from hazy to very cloudy.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** In darker versions, malt aromas and flavors can optionally include low roasted malt character expressed as cocoa/chocolate or caramel. Aromatic toffee, caramel, or biscuit character may also be present. Low level roastiness, graininess, or tannin astringency is acceptable when balanced with low to medium malt sweetness.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Low to medium-high
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low to medium
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Low levels of spicy and fruity ester aromas are typical. Yeast-derived aroma and flavor attributes such as clove-like or other phenolics may be present when consistent with underlying beer style. These beers can be fermented with either ale or lager yeast. Diacetyl should not be present. Low to medium yeast aroma may be present in versions packaged with yeast.
- **Body:** Low to medium. Rye can impart textural qualities ranging from dry and crisp to smooth and velvety.
- **Additional notes:** The grist should include sufficient rye so that rye character is evident in the beer. Rye character is often described as spicy and/or black pepper-like and/or earthy. Beers brewed with rye that do not exhibit rye character should be categorized in other beer styles. Versions served with yeast should possess a full yeasty mouthfeel. <br/>
