<h1>Kentucky Common Beer</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Medium to deep amber</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Chill haze or yeast haze is acceptable</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Medium-low to medium. Sweet malt is the dominant flavor attribute. Notes of corn, caramel, toffee and/or bread may be present.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Low to medium. May exhibit floral or spicy attributes typical of early 20th century North American hop varieties.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Low to medium-low fruity esters may be present. Very low levels of DMS, if present, are acceptable. Diacetyl should not be present.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Medium-low to medium with a dry finish enhanced by high carbonation</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> This American-born regional style proliferated around Louisville, Kentucky, from the Civil War era until Prohibition. Corn grits or flakes were commonly used at a rate or 25-35% of the total grist. Minerally attributes resulted from the use of hard brewing water. These beers were consumed very young, going from brewhouse to consumer in as little as one week. Early 20th century brewing literature mentions a slight tartness developing during fermentation as a characteristic attribute of this style. If tartness is present in modern versions, it should be at very low levels.</li>
</ul>
