<h1>American-Style India Pale Ale</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Pale to copper</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Hop haze is allowable at any temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Medium-low to medium intensity malt attributes are present in aroma and flavor</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> High to very high, exhibiting a wide range of attributes including floral, piney, citrus, fruity (berry, tropical, stone fruit and other), sulfur, diesel-like, onion-garlic, catty, resinous and many others.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Medium-high to very high</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Fruity esters are low to high. Diacetyl and DMS should not be present.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Medium-low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> The use of water with high mineral content may result in a crisp, dry beer rather than a malt-accentuated version. Sugar adjuncts may be used to enhance body and balance. Hops of varied origins may be used for bitterness or for approximating traditional American character. Versions of this style brewed with darker malts, non- traditional ale yeasts, fruits, spices, or other flavorings are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ales. <br/>
<em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, competition organizers may choose to create subcategories which reflect the use of colored malts and associated hue and aroma and flavor attributes, or based on types of hops used.</em></li>
</ul>
