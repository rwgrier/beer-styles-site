<h1>Belgian-Style Tripel</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Pale to pale gold</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned and may exhibit slight yeast haze. However, yeast should not be intentionally roused.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Low sweetness from very pale malts should be present. There should be no roasted or dark malt character.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Low, if present</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Medium to medium-high</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> A complex, sometimes mildly spicy, aroma and flavor characterize this style. Clove-like phenolic aroma and flavor may be very low. Fruity esters, including banana, are also common, but not required. Traditional Tripels are often well attenuated. Alcohol strength and flavor should be present.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Medium</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Head should be dense and mousse-like. Herbs or spices such as coriander or others may be used in subtle amounts to enhance overall aroma or flavor, or may be absent. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the body. Hop/malt character should be balanced. The overall beer flavor may finish sweet, though any sweet finish should be light.</li>
</ul>
