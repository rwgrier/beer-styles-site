<h1>Belgian-Style Flanders Oud Bruin or Oud Red Ale</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Copper to very dark. SRM/EBC color values can be misleading because the red spectrum of color is not accurately assessed by these measurement systems.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Some versions may be more highly carbonated. Bottle conditioned versions may appear cloudy when served.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Roasted malt aromas and flavors including cocoa are acceptable at low levels. A very low level of malt sweetness may be present and balanced by acidity from <em>Lactobacillus</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Not present</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Very low to medium-low, though acidity and wood aging (if used) may mask higher bitterness levels.</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> <em>Brettanomyces</em>-produced aromas and flavors should be absent or very low. Fruity esters expressed as cherry or green apple attributes are apparent. Overall flavor of Oud Bruin is fundamentally characterized by low to high lactic sourness. Many versions express very low to medium acetic sourness and aroma; acetic sourness may also be absent.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Low to medium-low with a refreshing mouthfeel</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Oaky or woody flavors may be pleasantly integrated. Flavors of wine or distilled spirits associated with used barrels should not be present. Bottle conditioned versions are often a blend of old and young beer to create the brewerâ€™s intended flavor balance.</li>
</ul>
