# Classic French & Belgian-Style Saison

- **Color:** Straw to light amber
- **Clarity:** Chill haze or slight yeast haze is acceptable
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Low, but providing foundation for the overall balance.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Low to medium and characterized by European-type hops: floral, herbal and/or woody traits are common.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium-low to medium, but not assertive.
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity esters are medium to high. Low to medium-low level phenolics may be present, expressed as spice-like or other attributes. Phenolics should not be harsh or dominant and should be in harmony with ester profile and hops. Fruity and spicy black pepper attributes derived from Belgian yeast are common. Diacetyl should not be present. Low levels of _Brettanomyces_ yeast-derived flavors that are slightly acidic, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like, may be present but are not required. These beers are well attenuated and often bottle conditioned contributing some yeast character and high carbonation.
- **Body:** Very low to low
