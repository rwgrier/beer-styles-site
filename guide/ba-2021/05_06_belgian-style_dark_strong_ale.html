<h1>Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Amber to very dark</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Medium to high malt aroma and complex fruity aromas are distinctive. Medium to high malt intensity can be rich, creamy, and sweet. Fruity complexity along with soft roasted malt flavor adds distinct character.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Yeast-derived phenolic spicy flavors and aromas are present at low to medium-low levels. Diacetyl is usually absent in these beers but may be present at very low levels.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Medium to full</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> These beers are often (though not always) brewed with dark Belgian candy sugar. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. These beers are typically well attenuated with a deceptive alcoholic strength.</li>
</ul>
