# Brett Beer

- **Color:** Any color is acceptable. Beer color may be influenced by the color of added fruits or other ingredients.
- **Clarity:** Chill or yeast haze is allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** In darker versions, any of roasted malt, caramel or chocolate aroma and flavor attributes are present at low levels.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Low to high
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low to high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Medium to high fruity esters are present. Subtle acidity/tartness resulting from _Brettanomyces_ fermentation results in a complex flavor profile. _Brettanomyces_ character should be present at low to high levels, expressed as any of horsey, goaty, leathery, phenolic, or fruity aroma and flavor attributes. _Brettanomyces_ character may or may not be dominant. Subtle acidity/tartness from _Brettanomyces_ should be low to medium-low but may increase with exposure to oxygen during barrel aging. Cultured yeast strains may be used in the fermentation. Beers fermented with _Brettanomyces_ that do not exhibit attributes typical of _Brettanomyces_ fermentation are categorized elsewhere. Beers in this style should not incorporate bacteria or exhibit a bacteria-derived flavor profile. Diacetyl and DMS should not be present.
- **Body:** Low to high
- **Additional notes:** Fruited versions will exhibit fruit flavors in balance with other elements. Wood vessels may be used for fermentation and aging; such beers may or may not exhibit attributes typical of wood- aging such as vanillin or of liquids previously aged in a barrel (bourbon, sherry, etc.) A beer exhibiting additional sensory attributes arising from microbes other than Brett is categorized as Mixed Culture Brett Beer. Various India Pale Ales fermented with Brett are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale.<br/>
