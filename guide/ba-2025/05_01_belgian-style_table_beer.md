# Belgian-Style Table Beer

- **Color:** Gold to black. Caramel color is sometimes added to adjust color.
- **Clarity:** Beer color may be too dark to perceive. When clarity is perceivable, chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Mild malt character may be present
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not present to very low
- **Perceived bitterness:** Very low to low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Diacetyl should not be present. Traditional versions do not use artificial sweeteners nor are they excessively sweet. More modern versions can incorporate sweeteners such as sugar and saccharin added post fermentation for additional sweetness and to increase smoothness.
- **Body:** Low
- **Additional notes:** These beers may contain malted barley, wheat, and rye as well as unmalted wheat, rye, oats, and corn. Though not common, flavorings such as coriander or orange and lemon peel are sometimes added, but are barely perceptible. The mouthfeel is light to moderate, and sometimes boosted with unfermented sugars/malt sugars. Low carbonation and aftertaste are typical.
