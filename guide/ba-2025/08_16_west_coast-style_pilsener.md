# West Coast-Style Pilsener

- **Color:** Straw to Gold
- **Clarity:** Hop haze or chill haze is allowable at low levels
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Low to medium. May include pilsener malt attributes such as bready, toasty, or cracker-like.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Medium-high to very high, exhibiting a wide range of attributes including floral, piney, citrus, fruity (berry, tropical, stone fruit, and other), sulfur, dank, diesel-like, catty, resinous, and many others.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium to high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity esters range from absent to medium-low; DMS, acetaldehyde, and diacetyl should not be present. Light sulfur character that enhances hop expression is allowable.
- **Body:** Low to medium. In balance to support high dry hop rates.
- **Additional notes:** This style of beer should balance the fresh, assertive expression of Pacific Northwest or Southern Hemisphere hops with the drinkability found in a pilsener. Kettle hops can be either noble European/noble-type hops or modern IPA hops, though the pronounced hop expression showcases modern IPA hops. Crispness and drinkability are at the forefront of the style, but body and structure are needed to balance a significant dry hop load. Beers dry hopped with European/noble hops should be classified as Italian-Style Pilsener.
