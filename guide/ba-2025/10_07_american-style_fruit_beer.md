# American-Style Fruit Beer

- **Color:** Can range from pale to very dark depending on the underlying style and is often influenced by the color of added fruit
- **Clarity:** Clear or hazy is acceptable
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Not present to medium-low
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not present to medium-low
- **Perceived bitterness:** In balance with fruit character and usually at very low to medium levels
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** American-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional German, British or American ale or lager yeast. Beers fermented with Belgian-style, German-style Hefeweizen or other South German wheat beer or Berliner-style Weisse yeasts should be categorized elsewhere. Fruit beers exhibiting sourness should be categorized elsewhere. Typical attributes of wild fermentation should not be present.
- **Body:** Varies with style
- **Additional notes:** Fruit aromas, ranging from subtle to intense, should be present and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Fruit or fruit extracts, used as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, provide harmonious fruit character ranging from subtle to intense. Within the framework of these guidelines, fruit beers fermented with Belgian yeast (Wit, Abbey, Farmhouse, Saison, or _Brettanomyces_) should be categorized as Belgian- Style Fruit Beers, or possibly as fruited Brett Beers. Some beers may fit into this category if they contain fruity adjuncts but no actual fruit. As an example, a juniper berry-flavored beer with notable juniper berry fruity flavor or aroma would be categorized as a Fruit Beer, whereas a beer in which the juniper berry character is more herbal or spicy would be categorized as an Herb and Spice Beer. Fruit Beers brewed with more than 30% wheat are categorized as Fruit Wheat Beers. Fruit Beers brewed with unusual fermentable(s), but no wheat, should be categorized as Fruit Beers. All of the various India Pale Ale or Imperial India Pale Ale styles brewed as Fruit Beers are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ales. All fruited Sour Beers are categorized elsewhere. All fruited Wood- and Barrel-Aged beers whether sour or not are categorized elsewhere. Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is defined as a vegetable, and a beer containing coconut is categorized as Field Beer. Likewise beers containing chili peppers are categorized as Chili Beer.<br/>
