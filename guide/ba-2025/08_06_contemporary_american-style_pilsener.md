# Contemporary American-Style Pilsener

- **Color:** Straw to gold
- **Clarity:** Appearance should be clear. Chill haze should not be present
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Medium-low to medium
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Medium to high. While traditional versions exhibit attributes typical of noble-type hops, contemporary versions will exhibit attributes typical of a wide range of hop varieties.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium to medium-high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** DMS, acetaldehyde, fruity esters, and diacetyl should not be present.
- **Body:** Medium-low to medium
