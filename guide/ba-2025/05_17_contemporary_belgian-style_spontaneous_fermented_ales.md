- **Additional notes:** Contemporary Belgian-Style Spontaneous Fermented Ales takes its inspiration from the Traditional Gueuze whose origin is the Brussels area of Belgium. But these beers incorporate specialty malts, spice(s), fruit(s), or many other diverse ingredients and processes that influence the hue, aroma and flavor outcomes of the finished beers such that they differ significantly from traditional examples.<br/>
