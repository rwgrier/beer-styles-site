Examples of culinary ingredients used in these beers include, but are not limited to, chocolate, coffee, coconut, vanilla, maple syrup, peanut butter, and marshmallow as well as fruits, nuts, and spices. The addition of sugars from any source may contribute to the pronounced sweetness of these beers.<br/>
_While this category may overlap several other styles defined in these guidelines such as Chocolate or Cocoa Beers, Field Beers, and others, the combination of a dark beer base, elevated alcohol content, and rich, sweet, dessert-like flavor profiles sets this style apart as a unique entity. Wood or barrel-aged versions of these beers are classified elsewhere._
