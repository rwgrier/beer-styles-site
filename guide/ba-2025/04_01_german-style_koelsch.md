- **Clarity:** Chill haze should not be present

- **Additional notes:** Traditional examples often display persistent head retention. Small amounts of wheat can be used in brewing beers of this style.

Ale yeast is used for fermentation. Lager yeast is sometimes used for bottle conditioning or final cold conditioning.
