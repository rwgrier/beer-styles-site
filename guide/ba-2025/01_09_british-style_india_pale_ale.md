# British-Style India Pale Ale

- **Color:** Gold to copper
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Medium malt flavor should be present
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Medium to high, expressed as floral, herbal, earthy, stone fruit or other attributes from high hopping rates.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium to high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity esters are medium to high. Traditional interpretations are characterized by medium to medium-high alcohol content. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer with a subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. Diacetyl can be absent or may be present at very low levels.
- **Body:** Medium
- **Additional notes:** A wide range of hop varieties may be used for bitterness or for approximating traditional English hop character. The use of water with high mineral content may result in a crisp, dry beer rather than a malt-accentuated version.
