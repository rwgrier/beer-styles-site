# American-Style Ice Lager

- **Color:** Very pale to golden
- **Clarity:** Chill haze should not be present
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Low malt sweetness is present
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Low
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity-estery and diacetyl aromas and ﬂavors should not be perceived
- **Body:** Low to medium
- **Additional notes:** This style is slightly higher in alcohol than most other light-colored American-Style lagers. It has few or no adjuncts. Typically, these beers are chilled before ﬁltration so that ice crystals (which may or may not be removed) are formed. This process can contribute to a higher alcohol content (up to 0.5% more). _When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, organizers may wish to subcategorize this category into rice and corn subcategories._
