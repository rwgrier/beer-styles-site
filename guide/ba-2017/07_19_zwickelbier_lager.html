<h1>Kellerbier or Zwickelbier Lager</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Varies depending on the underlying German lager style</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Can be slightly hazy to moderately cloudy. A small amount of yeast haze is acceptable and traditional. These beers must be unﬁltered, but may become clear with age. May exhibit poor head retention.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Varies depending on the underlying German lager style</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Varies depending on underlying style. Dry hopped beers are acceptable.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Varies depending on underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Low to medium levels of sulfur should be apparent. Low levels of acetaldehyde or other volatiles normally scrubbed during fermentation may or may not be apparent in ﬂavor and aroma. Subtle or low fruity-estery aromas and ﬂavors may be apparent. Diacetyl should be absent. Kellerbier Lagers have low to medium carbonation.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Varies depending on underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Kellerbier Lagers are unﬁltered lagered versions of German lager beer styles such as Muenchner Helles, Dunkel, Dortmunder/Export, Bohemian Pilsener and German Pilsener. Sulfur and acetaldehyde should enhance the flavor of these beers. These unﬁltered beers are packaged and served with low to moderate amounts of yeast. These beers may be ﬁltered and dosed with yeast during packaging. <em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information should include the underlying Germanic lager beer style upon which the entry is based.</em></li>
</ul>
