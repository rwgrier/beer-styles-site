<h1>Contemporary Gose</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Straw to medium amber, and can take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Cloudy/hazy with suspended yeast</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Malt aroma and flavor is not perceived to very low</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Not perceived</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Not perceived</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by <em>Brettanomyces</em> yeasts may be evident but at low levels as these beers do not undergo prolonged aging. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Alternatively, they may be spontaneously fermented. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples expressed as a sharp, refreshing sourness.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Low to medium-low</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> These beers typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional examples containing oats. Contemporary examples may also contain other grains. A wide variety of herbal, spice, ﬂoral or fruity ﬂavors, not found in traditional Leipzig-Style Goses, can be present. Salt (table salt) and coriander additions are traditional in low amounts, and may or may not be present in Contemporary Gose. <em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include any herbs, spices, fruit or other added ingredients, and/or information about the brewing process.</em></li>
</ul>
