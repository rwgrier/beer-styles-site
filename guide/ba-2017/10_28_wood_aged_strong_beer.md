- **Color:** Varies with underlying style
- **Clarity:** Varies with underlying style
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Varies with underlying style
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Varies with underlying style

- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Typical of underlying style of beer being aged. Within the framework of these guidelines, these beers contain alcohol greater than 5.0% abw or 6.3% abv when consumed. Alcohol may be evident in stronger versions, in harmony with other flavor and aroma attributes, and not harsh.
- **Body:** Varies with underlying style
- **Additional notes:** Within the framework of these guidelines, these beers meet the criteria for color and alcohol content shown above. Lower alcohol (<5% abw or <6.3% abv) wood-aged beers would be categorized as other wood-aged beer styles. These are any traditional or experimental style of lager, ale or hybrid beer aged in either a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. These beers are aged with the intention of developing unique attributes imparted by the wood and/or by liquids that had previously been stored in contact with the wood. Wood aging does not necessarily impart wood ﬂavors, but does result in distinctive sensory outcomes. Used sherry, rum, whiskey, tequila, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to a beer. A balance of aroma, ﬂavor and mouthfeel results from the marriage of new beer with attributes imparted by the wood or barrel. These beers may or may not have _Brettanomyces_ character. Sour wood-aged beers would be categorized elsewhere. Fruited or spiced wood-aged beers which meet the criteria for color and alcohol content and which exhibit attributes of wood-aging would be categorized here and may take on the color, ﬂavors and aromas of added fruits or spices. _When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as length of time aged, type of wood or barrel, age, char level or previous liquids held by the wood, ingredients or other processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes._
