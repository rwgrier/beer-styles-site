- **Color:** Straw to pale
- **Clarity:** There should be no chill haze.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** A malty sweet aroma and flavor should be present.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Hop aroma and ﬂavor is moderate and pronounced, derived from late hopping (not dry hopping) with noble-type hops.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium to high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Very low levels of DMS aroma and ﬂavor, usually below most people’s thresholds, may be detectable by trained or sensitive palates. Other fermentation or hop-derived sulfur aromas and flavors may be perceived at low levels. Fruity-estery aromas and ﬂavors should not be perceived. These are well attenuated beers.
