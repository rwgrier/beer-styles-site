# Scotch Ale

- **Color:** Light reddish-brown to very dark
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Scotch Ales are aggressively malty with a rich and dominant sweet malt aroma and ﬂavor. A caramel character is often part of the proﬁle. Dark roasted malt ﬂavors may be evident at low levels.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not perceived to very low
- **Perceived bitterness:** Not perceived to very low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity esters, if present, are generally at low levels. Low levels of diacetyl are acceptable.
- **Body:** Full
- **Additional notes:** A brewery-fresh experience is intended with these beers. Oxidation is not an acceptable character. Pleasantly oxidized Scotch Ales should be classified in Aged Beer categories.	_When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, Strong Scotch Ale may be split into two subcategories: traditional (no smoke character) and peated (low level of peat smoke character). Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Strong Scotch Ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many examples with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. A peaty or smoky character may be evident at low levels. Strong Scotch Ales with medium or higher smoke character are considered smoke ﬂavored beers and should be categorized elsewhere._
