# German-Style Kölsch

- **Color:** Straw to gold
- **Clarity:** Chill haze should not be present
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Malt character is very low to low with soft sweetness. Caramel character should not be evident.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Hop aroma and flavor is low, and if evident, should express noble hop character.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium to medium-high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity-estery aromas and ﬂavors should be absent or present at very low levels. Light pear-apple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not required for this style. Diacetyl should not be perceived.
- **Body:** Low to medium-low. Dry and crisp.
- **Additional notes:** Traditional examples often display persistent head retention. Small amounts of wheat can be used in brewing beers of this style. Koelsch-style beers are fermented at warmer temperatures than is typical for lagers, but at lower temperatures than most English and Belgian-style ales. They are aged cold. Ale yeast is used for fermentation. Lager yeast is sometimes used for bottle conditioning or ﬁnal cold conditioning.
