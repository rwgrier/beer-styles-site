<h1>Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Varies with underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Varies with underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Varies with underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Varies with underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Varies with underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Typical of underlying style of sour beer being aged</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Varies with underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> These are any traditional or experimental style of lager, ale or hybrid beer aged in either a wooden barrel or in contact with wood, and exhibiting acidity derived from exposure to bacteria. These beers are aged in the presence of microflora (either present in the wood or introduced at some time in the brewing process) with the intention of introducing sourness to the beer. These beers are aged with the intention of developing unique attributes imparted by the wood and/or by liquids that had previously been stored in contact with the wood. Wood aging does not necessarily impart wood ﬂavors, but does result in distinctive sensory outcomes. Used sherry, rum, whiskey, tequila, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to a beer. A balance of aroma, ﬂavor and mouthfeel results from the marriage of new beer with attributes imparted by the wood or barrel, and with sourness and/or other attributes derived from bacteria. These beers may or may not have <em>Brettanomyces</em> character. Wood-aged sour beers made with spices or other ingredients which meet the criteria for color and alcohol content and which exhibit attributes of wood-aging and acidity would be categorized here and will exhibit attributes of those ingredients. <em>Versions made with fruit(s) will exhibit attributes of wood-aging, acidity and those added fruit(s). Competition organizers may choose to create subcategories for Wood-aged sour beers made with fruit(s). When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as length of time aged, type of wood or barrel, age, char level or previous liquids held by the wood, micro flora present if known, other ingredients or other processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes.</em></li>
