<h1>Belgian-Style Quadrupel</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Amber to dark brown</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Caramel, dark sugar and malty sweet ﬂavors and aromas can be intense, but not cloying, and should complement fruitiness.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Not perceived to very low</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Low to medium-low</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Perception of alcohol can be strong. Complex fruity ﬂavors, such as raisins, dates, ﬁgs, grapes and/or plums are often present and accompanied by a hint of wineyness. Clove-like phenolic ﬂavor and aroma should not be evident. Diacetyl and DMS should not be perceived.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Full with creamy mouthfeel</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Head should be dense and mousse-like. Quadrupels are well attenuated and are characterized by an intense alcohol presence balanced by other ﬂavors, aromas and bitterness. They are well balanced with savoring/sipping-type drinkability. Oxidized character, if present in aged Quads, should be mild and pleasant.</li>
</ul>
