# Special Bitter or Best Bitter

- **Color:** Deep gold to deep copper
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Medium residual malt sweetness should be present
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Very low to medium at the brewerâ€™s discretion
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium and not harsh
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Low carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-estery aromas and flavors and very low levels of diacetyl are acceptable, but should be minimized in this form of Bitter. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable.

- **Additional notes:** _When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, competition organizers may choose to create subcategories which reflect English and American hop character._
