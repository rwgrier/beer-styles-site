# South German-Style Weizenbock

- **Color:** Gold to very dark
- **Clarity:** If served with yeast, appearance may be very cloudy.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Medium malty sweetness should be present. If dark, a mild roast malt character should emerge in the flavor and, to a lesser degree, in the aroma.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not perceived
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Balanced, clove-like phenolic and fruity-estery banana notes produce a well-rounded ﬂavor and aroma. No diacetyl should be perceived. Carbonation should be high.
- **Body:** Medium to full
- **Additional notes:** These beers are made with at least 50 percent wheat malt. They are often roused during pouring, and when yeast is present, they will have a yeasty ﬂavor and a fuller mouthfeel.
