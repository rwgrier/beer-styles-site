# Fruit Wheat Beer

- **Color:** Generally straw to light amber, and often influenced by the color of added fruit.
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable. These beers may be served with or without yeast. When served with yeast, appearance is hazy to very cloudy.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Low to medium-low
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Low to medium
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low to medium
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** These beers can be fermented with either ale or lager yeast depending on the underlying wheat beer style. Low fruity-estery aroma and ﬂavor is typical. Diacetyl should not be perceived. In versions served with yeast, yeasty aroma and ﬂavor should be low to medium.
- **Body:** Low to medium
- **Additional notes:** The grist should include at least 30 percent malted wheat. Fruit or fruit extracts contribute aroma and ﬂavor expressing true fruit complexity. Versions served with yeast should demonstrate a full yeasty mouthfeel. Fruited versions of Berliner Weisse or Contemporary Gose would fall within those categories as they are commonly brewed with fruit. Fruited versions of South German style Weizens, Grodziskie, or other wheat beer styles would be categorized as Fruit Wheat Beers, as those styles are not commonly brewed with fruit. Such beers could deviate from parameters shown for those styles but should be suggestive of the underlying classic beer style with fruit added. Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is deﬁned as a vegetable, and beers containing coconut should be entered as Field Beers. _When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as fruit(s) used or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes._
