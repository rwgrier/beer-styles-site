# Scottish-Style Heavy Ale

- **Color:** Amber to dark brown
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Malty, caramel aroma is present. The style exhibits a medium degree of sweet malt and caramel. The overall impression is smooth and balanced.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Should not be perceived
- **Perceived bitterness:** Perceptible but low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Yeast attributes such as diacetyl and sulfur are acceptable at very low levels. Bottled versions may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Fruity-estery aromas, if evident, are low.
- **Body:** Medium with a soft chewy character
- **Additional notes:** _When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, Scottish Heavy Ale may be split into two subcategories: traditional (no smoke character) and peated (low level of peat smoke character). Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish Heavy Ale exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many examples with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. A peaty or smoky character may be evident at low levels. Scottish Heavy Ales with medium or higher smoke character are considered smoke ï¬‚avored beers and should be categorized elsewhere._
