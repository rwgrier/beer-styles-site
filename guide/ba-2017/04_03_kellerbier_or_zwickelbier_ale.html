<h1>Kellerbier or Zwickelbier Ale</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Varies depending on the underlying German ale style</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Can be clear to moderately cloudy. Slight yeast haze is acceptable and traditional. These beers are unﬁltered, but may become clear with age. May exhibit poor head retention.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Kellerbier ales are unﬁltered German-style Altbier or Koelsch. Malt aromas and flavors typical of these styles should be present.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Varies depending on underlying style. Hop character may be muted by the presence of yeast.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Varies depending on underlying style. Bitterness may be suppressed by the presence of yeast.</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Low to medium yeast aroma and flavor is desirable. Very low to moderately low levels of sulfur should be apparent. Low levels of acetaldehyde or other volatiles, normally reduced during lagering, may or may not be apparent. The presence of sulfur and acetaldehyde should enhance the flavor of these beers. Fruity-estery levels may vary slightly from the underlying styles due to age and presence of yeast.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Varies depending on underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> These unﬁltered beers are packaged and served with low to moderate amounts of yeast. They may be ﬁltered and dosed with yeast during packaging. Beers containing non-standard ingredients or aged in ﬂavor-imparting vessels would be categorized elsewhere. <em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information should include the underlying German ale style upon which the entry is based.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Vital Statistics:</h2>

<li>OG: Varies with style</li>
<li>FG: Varies with style</li>
<li>IBUs: Varies with style</li>
