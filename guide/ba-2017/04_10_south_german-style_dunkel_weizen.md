# South German-Style Dunkel Weizen

- **Color:** Copper-brown to very dark
- **Clarity:** If served with yeast, appearance may be very cloudy
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Distinct sweet maltiness and a chocolate-like character from roasted malt characterize this beer style. Dark barley malts are frequently used along with dark Cara or color malts.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not perceived
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** The phenolic and estery aromas and flavors typical of Weissbiers are present but less pronounced in Dunkel Weissbiers. Dunkel Weissbiers should be well attenuated and very highly carbonated. No diacetyl should be perceived

- **Additional notes:** These beers are made with at least 50 percent wheat malt. They are often roused during pouring, and when yeast is present, they will have a yeasty ï¬‚avor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel.
