# American-Style Sour Ale

- **Color:** Pale to black depending on underlying beer style.
- **Clarity:** Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze is acceptable at any temperature.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Low. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel and chocolate aromas and flavors should be present at low levels.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Low to high
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low to high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Moderate to intense, yet balanced, fruity-estery aromas and flavors are evident. Diacetyl, DMS and _Brettanomyces_ should not be perceived in aroma or flavor. The evolution of natural acidity develops a balanced complexity. The acidity present is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidiﬁed malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and attributes of age. Moderate to intense, yet balanced, fruity-estery ﬂavors should be evident. There should be no residual ﬂavors from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived ﬂavors such as vanillin should not be present.
- **Body:** Low to high
- **Additional notes:** Such beers exhibiting wood-derived characters or characters of liquids previously aged in wood are characterized as Wood-Aged Sour Beer. _Competition organizers may create subcategories which reflect groups of entries based on color, hop varieties, microflora, fruit, spices or other ingredients, wood aging, etc. Fruited versions will exhibit fruitiness in harmony with malt, hop, acidity and other characteristics of fermentation. Such beers may take on the color of fruits or other ingredients. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes._
