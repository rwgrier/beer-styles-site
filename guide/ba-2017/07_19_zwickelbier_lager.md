Sulfur and acetaldehyde should enhance the flavor of these beers. These unﬁltered beers are packaged and served with low to moderate amounts of yeast. These beers may be ﬁltered and dosed with yeast during packaging. _When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries.
