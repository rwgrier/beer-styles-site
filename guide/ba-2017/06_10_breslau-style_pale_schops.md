# Breslau-Style Pale Schöps

- **Color:** Straw to light amber
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Malt sweetness is medium to medium-high. A high proportion of pale wheat malt (as much as 80 percent) is used to brew these beers as well as Pilsener and other pale specialty malts. They may have a bready, aromatic biscuit malt aroma, but should not display caramel character.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Very low
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium-low to medium
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity-estery aromas may be evident as these beers are fermented with ale yeast as opposed to wheat beer yeast. Fruity-estery ﬂavors may be present. Diacetyl and phenolic aromas and ﬂavors should not be perceived.
- **Body:** Full
- **Additional notes:** Traditional German wheat beer yeast is not used in this style of beer
