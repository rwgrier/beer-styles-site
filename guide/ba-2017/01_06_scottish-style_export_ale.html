<h1>Scottish-Style Export Ale</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Medium amber to dark chestnut brown</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Sweet malt and caramel aromas and flavors define the character of a Scottish Export</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Should not be perceived</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Fruity-estery character may be apparent. Yeast attributes such as diacetyl and sulfur are acceptable at very low levels. Bottled versions may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Medium</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> <em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, Scottish Export Ale may be split into two subcategories: traditional (no smoke character) and peated (low level of peat smoke character). Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish Export Ale exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many examples with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. A peaty or smoky character may be evident at low levels. Scottish Export Ales with medium or higher smoke character are considered smoke ï¬‚avored beers and should be categorized elsewhere.</em></li>
</ul>
