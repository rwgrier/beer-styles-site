# Berliner-Style Weisse

- **Color:** Straw to pale. These are the lightest of all the German wheat beers. Versions made with fruits or other flavorings may take on corresponding hues.
- **Clarity:** May appear hazy or cloudy from yeast or chill haze
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Malt sweetness is absent
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not perceived
- **Perceived bitterness:** Non-existent to very low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity-estery aroma and ﬂavor should be evident at low to medium levels. Diacetyl should not be perceived. _Brettanomyces_ character may be absent or present at low to medium levels, and if present may be expressed as horsey, goaty, leathery, phenolic, fruity and/or acidic aromas and flavors. The unique combination of yeast and lactic acid bacteria fermentation yields a beer that is acidic and highly attenuated.
- **Body:** Very low
- **Additional notes:** Carbonation is high. Berliners are sometimes served with sweet fruit or herbal syrups.	_When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Subcategories for unfruited and fruited or ﬂavored versions of the style could be created. For unfruited versions, brewer would indicate that no fruit or ﬂavor has been added. Fruited or ﬂavored entries would be accompanied by a very brief description of the fruit/ﬂavor used by the brewer._
