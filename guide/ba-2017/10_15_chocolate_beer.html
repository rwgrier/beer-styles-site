<h1>Chocolate or Cocoa Beer</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Light amber to black depending on the underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Clear to hazy beer is acceptable</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Medium-low to medium-high malt sweetness balanced with cocoa ﬂavors and aromas</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Hop aroma is not perceived to very low. Hop ﬂavor may be lower than is designated for underlying style allowing chocolate to contribute to the ﬂavor proﬁle without becoming excessively bitter.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Very low to medium-low</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Chocolate should dominate the flavor profile, though other ﬂavors may be present.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Varies with underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Chocolate Beers are any beers incorporating dark chocolate or cocoa in any form. Chocolate or cocoa character can range from subtle to intense. Beers made with white chocolate do not typify this category. <em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as type or form of chocolate used or other factors which influence perceived sensory outcomes.</em></li>
</ul>
