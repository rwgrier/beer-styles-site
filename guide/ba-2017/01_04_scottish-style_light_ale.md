# Scottish-Style Light Ale

- **Color:** Golden to light brown
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Malty, caramel aroma may be present. A low to medium-low, soft and chewy caramel malt ﬂavor should be present.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Should not be perceived
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Yeast attributes such as diacetyl and sulfur are acceptable at very low levels. Bottled versions may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Fruity-estery aromas, if evident, are low.
- **Body:** Low
- **Additional notes:** _When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, Scottish Light Ale may be split into two subcategories: traditional (no smoke character) and peated (low level of peat smoke character). Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditional Scottish Light Ale exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many examples with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. A peaty or smoky character may be evident at low levels. Scottish Light Ales with medium or higher smoke character are considered smoke ﬂavored beers and should be categorized elsewhere._
