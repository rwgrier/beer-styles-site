# American-Style Barley Wine Ale

- **Color:** Amber to deep red/copper-garnet
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Caramel and/or toffee malt aromas are often present. High residual malty sweetness, often with caramel and/or toffee ﬂavors, should be present.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Hop aroma and flavor is medium to very high. American hop varieties are often used, but are not required for this style.
- **Perceived bitterness:** High
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Complex alcohols are evident. Fruity-estery aromas and ﬂavors are often high. Very low levels of diacetyl are acceptable.
- **Body:** Full
- **Additional notes:** Indications of oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and/or ﬂavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style barley wine ales. However, if a low level of age-induced oxidized character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience, this can be regarded favorably.
