# Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale

- **Color:** Medium amber to very dark
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Medium to high malt aroma and complex fruity aromas are distinctive. Medium to high malt intensity can be rich, creamy and sweet. Fruity complexity along with soft roasted malt ﬂavor adds distinct character.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Low to medium
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low to medium
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Very little or no diacetyl character should be perceived. Low levels of phenolic spiciness may be perceived.
- **Body:** Medium to full
- **Additional notes:** These beers are often (though not always) brewed with dark Belgian candy sugar. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately ﬂavor these strong ales. These beers can be well attenuated with a deceptive alcoholic strength.
