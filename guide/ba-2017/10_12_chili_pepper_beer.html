<h1>Chili Pepper Beer</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Can range from pale to very dark depending on the underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Clear or hazy is acceptable</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Can vary from very low to medium-high depending on the underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Very low to very high</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Very low to medium-high</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Chili pepper aroma and ﬂavor attributes should be harmonious with the underlying beer style. Chili pepper character may be expressed as vegetal, spicy and/or hot on the palate.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Representative of underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Chili Beers are any beers using chili peppers for ﬂavor, aroma and/or heat. Chili character can range from subtle to intense. Chili pepper aroma may or may not be evident. Within the framework of these guidelines, all beers containing chili peppers would be categorized as Chili Beers. Beers which represent more than one style, such as chili beers with chocolate, would be categorized as Chili Beers. <em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as chili(s) used or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes.</em></li>
