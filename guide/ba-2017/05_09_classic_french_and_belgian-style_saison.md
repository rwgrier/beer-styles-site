# Classic French & Belgian-Style Saison

- **Color:** Gold to light amber
- **Clarity:** Chill haze or slight yeast haze is acceptable
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Low, but providing foundation for the overall balance.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Low to medium and characterized by European-type hops: floral, herbal and/or woody traits are common.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium-low to medium, but not assertive.
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity-estery aromas and ﬂavors are medium to high. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Very low levels of _Brettanomyces_ yeast-derived ﬂavors that are slightly acidic, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like, may be evident but are not required. Fruitiness and spicy black pepper derived from Belgian yeast is common. These beers are well attenuated and often bottle conditioned contributing some yeast character and high carbonation.
- **Body:** Very low to low
