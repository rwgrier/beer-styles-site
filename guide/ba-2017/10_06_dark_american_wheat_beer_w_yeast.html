<h1>Dark American Wheat Beer with Yeast</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Medium amber to dark brown</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> This style is packaged with yeast in the bottle so appearance may range from hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is acceptable.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Malt aromas and ﬂavors can include low roasted malt character expressed as cocoa, chocolate or caramel as well as toffee or biscuit. Medium-low to medium-high malt sweetness is present. Roast malt astringency is acceptable when balanced with malt sweetness.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Low fruity-estery aroma and ﬂavor is typical. Yeast character should be low to medium and should not dominate malt and hops. Diacetyl and clove-like phenolics should not be perceived.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> These beers can be fermented with either ale or lager yeast. The grist should include at least 30 percent malted wheat. Because this style is served with yeast, there should be a full yeasty mouthfeel.</li>
</ul>
