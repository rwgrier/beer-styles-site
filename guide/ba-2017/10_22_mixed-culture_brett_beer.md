# Mixed-Culture Brett Beer

- **Color:** Any color is acceptable. Beer color may be influenced by the color of added fruits or other ingredients.
- **Clarity:** Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze is allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel and chocolate aromas and ﬂavors are present at low levels.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Low to high
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low to high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Moderate to intense fruity-estery aromas and ﬂavors are evident. Acidity resulting from fermentation with _Brettanomyces_ and/or bacteria results in a complex flavor profile. _Brettanomyces_ character should be present and expressed as horsey, goaty, leathery, phenolic, fruity and/or acidic aromas and flavors. Cultured yeast may be used in the fermentation. Bacteria should be incorporated and in evidence. Bacteria will contribute acidity which may or may not dominate the flavor profile. Diacetyl and DMS should not be perceived.
- **Body:** Low to high
- **Additional notes:** Fruited versions will exhibit fruit ﬂavors in balance with other elements. Wood vessels may be used for fermentation and aging, but wood-derived aromas and ﬂavors such as vanillin should not be present. Versions exhibiting attributes derived from wood or liquids previously aged in wood would be classified in other Wood-Aged Beer categories. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales would be classified in other style categories.	_When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries.
