# Belgian-Style Quadrupel

- **Color:** Amber to dark brown
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Caramel, dark sugar and malty sweet ﬂavors and aromas can be intense, but not cloying, and should complement fruitiness.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not perceived to very low
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low to medium-low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Perception of alcohol can be strong. Complex fruity ﬂavors, such as raisins, dates, ﬁgs, grapes and/or plums are often present and accompanied by a hint of wineyness. Clove-like phenolic ﬂavor and aroma should not be evident. Diacetyl and DMS should not be perceived.
- **Body:** Full with creamy mouthfeel
- **Additional notes:** Head should be dense and mousse-like. Quadrupels are well attenuated and are characterized by an intense alcohol presence balanced by other ﬂavors, aromas and bitterness. They are well balanced with savoring/sipping-type drinkability. Oxidized character, if present in aged Quads, should be mild and pleasant.
