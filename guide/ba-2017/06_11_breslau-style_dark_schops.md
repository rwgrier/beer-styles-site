# Breslau-Style Dark Schöps

- **Color:** Dark brown to black
- **Clarity:** Beer color may be too dark to perceive. When clarity is perceivable, chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Malt sweetness is medium to medium-high. Roast malt bitterness may be evident at low levels. A high proportion of dark wheat malt (as much as 80%) is used to brew these beers as along with other specialty toasted and dark specialty malts. They have a pronounced malt character with aromas of toasted or nutty malt, but lack caramel character.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Very low
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity-estery aromas and flavors may be evident as these beers are fermented with ale yeast, but not with traditional wheat beer yeast. Diacetyl and phenolic aromas and ﬂavors should not be perceived.
- **Body:** Full
