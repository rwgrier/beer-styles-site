# Light American Wheat Beer with Yeast

- **Color:** Pale to light amber
- **Clarity:** These beers are packaged with yeast in the bottle, so appearance may range from hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is acceptable.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Low to medium-low malt aroma and sweet malt ﬂavor is present
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Low to medium
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low to medium
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Yeast character should be low to medium and should not dominate the character of malt and hops. Phenolic, clove-like aromas should not be perceived. Low fruity-estery aroma and ﬂavor is typical. Diacetyl and phenolic, clove-like character should not be perceived.
- **Body:** Low to medium
- **Additional notes:** These beers can be fermented with either ale or lager yeast. The grist should include at least 30 percent malted wheat. Because this style is served with yeast, there should be a full yeasty mouthfeel.
