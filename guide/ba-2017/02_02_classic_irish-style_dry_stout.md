# Classic Irish-Style Dry Stout

- **Color:** Black
- **Clarity:** Opaque
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** The prominence of coffee-like roasted barley and a moderate degree of roasted malt aroma and flavor deﬁnes much of the character. Dry stouts achieve a dry-roasted character through the use of roasted barley. Initial malt and light caramel ﬂavors give way to a distinctive dry-roasted bitterness in the ﬁnish.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** European hop character may range from not perceived to low in aroma and ﬂavor
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium to medium-high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity-estery character is low relative to malt and roasted barley as well as hop bitterness. Diacetyl, if present, should be very low. Slight acidity may be perceived but is not required.
- **Body:** Medium-light to medium
- **Additional notes:** Head retention should be persistent
