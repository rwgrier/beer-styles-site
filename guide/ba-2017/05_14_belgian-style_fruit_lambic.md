# Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic

- **Color:** Often influenced by the color of added fruit
- **Clarity:** Cloudiness is acceptable
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Malt sweetness should be absent, but sweetness of fruit may be low to high.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Hop aroma and ﬂavor is not perceived. Cheesy hop character should not be perceived.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Very low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic aromas and ﬂavors derived from _Brettanomyces_ yeast are often present at moderate levels. Fermented sourness is an important part of the ﬂavor proﬁle, though sweetness may compromise the intensity. Fruit sourness may also be an important part of the proﬁle. These ﬂavored Lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet. Vanillin and other woody ﬂavors should not be evident.
- **Body:** Dry to full
- **Additional notes:** These beers, also known by the names Framboise, Kriek, Peche, Cassis, etc., are characterized by fruit aromas and ﬂavors. Fruit Lambics, whose origin is the Brussels area of Belgium, are often simply called Fruit Lambic. Versions of this beer style made outside of the Brussels area are said to be “Belgian-Style Fruit Lambics.” The Belgian-style versions are made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional Lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or other sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or other sweeteners. See also Belgian-Style Lambic for additional background information.
