# English-Style India Pale Ale

- **Color:** Gold to copper
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Medium malt ﬂavor should be present
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Hop aroma and ﬂavor is medium to high, and often ﬂowery. Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character should be perceived, but may result from the skillful use of hops of other origin.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium to high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity-estery ﬂavors are moderate to very high. Traditional interpretations are characterized by medium to medium-high alcohol content. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer with a subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels.
- **Body:** Medium
- **Additional notes:** Non-English hops may be used for bitterness or for approximating traditional English hop character. The use of water with high mineral content may result in a crisp, dry beer rather than a malt-accentuated version.
