<h1>Old Ale</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Copper-red to very dark</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Fruity-estery aroma can contribute to the malt aroma and ﬂavor proﬁle. Old Ales have a malt and sometimes caramel sweetness.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Very low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Evident but minimal</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Fruity-estery ﬂavors can contribute to the character of this ale. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of Old Ales is that they undergo an aging process, often for years. Aging can occur on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle. This contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidized character. Complex estery attributes may also emerge. Very low diacetyl character may be evident and is acceptable.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Medium to full</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Wood-aged attributes such as vanilla are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character and acidity produced by Brettanomyces may also be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other ﬂavors. Residual ﬂavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel, such as bourbon or sherry, should not be present. <em>This style may be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces and acidic characters reﬂect historical character. Competition organizers may choose to distinguish these types of old ale from modern versions.</em></li>
</ul>
