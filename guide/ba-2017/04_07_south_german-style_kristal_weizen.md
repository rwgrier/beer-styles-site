# South German-Style Kristal Weizen

- **Color:** Straw to amber
- **Clarity:** Clear with no chill haze present. Because the beer is ﬁltered, no yeast should be present.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Malt sweetness is very low to medium-low
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not perceived to very low
- **Perceived bitterness:** Very low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** The aroma and flavor is very similar to Hefeweizen with the caveat that fruity and phenolic characters are not combined with the yeasty ﬂavor and fuller-bodied mouthfeel of yeast. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-like or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. A Banana-like ester aroma and flavor is often present. No diacetyl should be perceived. Kristal Weizens are well attenuated and very highly carbonated.
- **Body:** Medium to full
- **Additional notes:** These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat. They have no yeast ﬂavor and they exhibit a cleaner, drier mouthfeel than counterparts served with yeast.
