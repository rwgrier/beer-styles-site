<h1>Brett Beer</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Any color is acceptable. Beer color may be influenced by the color of added fruits or other ingredients.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Chill haze and/or haze from yeast is allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel and chocolate aromas and ﬂavors are present at low levels.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Low to high</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Low to high</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Acidity resulting from <em>Brettanomyces</em> fermentation results in a complex flavor profile. <em>Brettanomyces</em> character, at low to high levels, should be present and expressed as horsey, goaty, leathery, phenolic, fruity and/or acidic aromas and flavors. <em>Brettanomyces</em> character may or may not be dominant. Acidity from <em>Brettanomyces</em> should be low to medium-low. Cultured yeast strains may be used in the fermentation. Beers fermented with <em>Brettanomyces</em> that do not display <em>Brettanomyces</em> character would be classified in another style category. Beers in this style should not incorporate bacteria or exhibit a bacteria-derived flavor profile. Moderate to intense fruity-estery aromas and ﬂavors should be evident. Diacetyl and DMS should not be perceived.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Low to high</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Fruited versions will exhibit fruit ﬂavors in balance with other elements. Wood vessels may be used for fermentation and aging, but wood- derived ﬂavors and aromas such as vanillin should not be present. Residual ﬂavors and aromas originating from liquids previously aged in a barrel (bourbon, sherry, etc.) should not be present. Versions exhibiting attributes derived from wood or liquids previously aged in wood would be classified in other Wood-Aged Beer categories. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales would be classified in other style categories.   <em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as type of Brett(s) used, fruit(s) or other ingredients used or other factors which influence perceived sensory outcomes.</em></li>
