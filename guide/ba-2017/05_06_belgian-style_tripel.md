# Belgian-Style Tripel

- **Color:** Pale to light amber
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned and may exhibit slight yeast haze. However, yeast should not be intentionally roused.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Low sweetness from very pale malts should be present. There should be no roasted or dark malt character.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Low, if present
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium to medium-high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** A complex, sometimes mildly spicy, aroma and ﬂavor characterize this style. Clove-like phenolic aroma and ﬂavor may be very low. Fruity-estery aromas and ﬂavors, including banana, are also common, but not required. Traditional Tripels are often well attenuated. Alcohol strength and ﬂavor should be perceived.
- **Body:** Medium
- **Additional notes:** Head should be dense and mousse-like. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the body. Hop/malt character should be balanced. The overall beer ﬂavor may ﬁnish sweet, though any sweet ﬁnish should be light. Oxidized character, if evident in aged Tripels, should be mild and pleasant.
