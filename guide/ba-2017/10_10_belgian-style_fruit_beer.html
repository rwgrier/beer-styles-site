<h1>Belgian-Style Fruit Beer</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Can range from pale to dark depending on underlying Belgian style, and is often influenced by the color of added fruit</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Clear to hazy beer is acceptable</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Can vary from not perceived to medium-high</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Low to high</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Varies with underlying Belgian style</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Acidic bacterial fermentation attributes may be evident. If present, it contributes to acidity and enhances fruity balance.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Varies with style</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Fruit aromas, ranging from subtle to intense, should be evident and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian yeast, (Wit, Abbey, Farmhouse, etc.). Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is deÔ¨Åned as a vegetable, and beers containing coconut would be categorized as Field Beers. Fruit or fruit extracts, used as adjuncts in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, provide harmonious fruit character ranging from subtle to intense. Classifying these beers can be complex. Fruited Belgian-style beers which exhibit <em>Brettanomyces</em> may be categorized in this style, when no other category exists for such beers. However, a fruited Saison exhibiting Brett character would be categorized as a Specialty Saison. A fruited version of a Brett Beer is categorized as Fruited Brett Beer when such a Brett-containing beer is not based on an existing underlying Belgian beer style. A Lambic-Style fruit beer would be categorized as a Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic. Fruited Belgian-style beers brewed with additional adjuncts could fall in this category or perhaps as Experimental Beers. Fruit beers fermented with German, British or American ale or lager yeast would be categorized as American-Style Fruit Beers or as Fruit Wheat Beers. <em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as fruit(s) used or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes.</em></li>
