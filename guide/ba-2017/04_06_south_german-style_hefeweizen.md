- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Med-low to med-high fruity and phenolic attributes are hallmarks of this style. Phenolic attributes such as clove, nutmeg, smoke and vanilla are present. Banana ester aroma and ﬂavor should be present at low to medium-high levels. No diacetyl should be perceived.
