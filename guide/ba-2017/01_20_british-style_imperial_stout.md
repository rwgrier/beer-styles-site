# British-Style Imperial Stout

- **Color:** Ranging from dark copper typical of some historic examples, to very dark more typical of contemporary examples
- **Clarity:** Opaque in darker versions. When clarity is perceivable, chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Extremely rich malty ﬂavor, often expressed as toffee or caramel, and may be accompanied by very low roasted malt astringency.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Very low to medium, with ﬂoral, citrus or herbal qualities.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium, and should not overwhelm the overall balance. The bitterness may be higher in darker versions while maintaining balance with sweet malt.
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** High alcohol content is evident. High fruity-estery character may be present. Diacetyl should be absent.
- **Body:** Full
- **Additional notes:** This style was also originally called “Russian Imperial Stout.”
