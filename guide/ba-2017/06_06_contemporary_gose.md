A wide variety of herbal, spice, ﬂoral or fruity ﬂavors, not found in traditional Leipzig-Style Goses, can be present. Salt (table salt) and coriander additions are traditional in low amounts, and may or may not be present in Contemporary Gose. _When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries.
