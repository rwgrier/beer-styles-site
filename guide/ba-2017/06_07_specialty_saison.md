# Specialty Saison

- **Color:** Pale to dark brown
- **Clarity:** Chill haze or slight yeast haze is acceptable
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Typically low to medium-low, but may vary in beers made with specialty malts.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** low to medium
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium to medium-high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity-estery aromas are medium to high. Diacetyl character should not be perceived. Complex alcohols, herbs, spices, low _Brettanomyces_ attributes including slightly acidic, fruity, horsey, goaty and leather-like, as well as clovey and smoky phenolics may be present. Herb and/or spice ﬂavors, including notes of black pepper, may be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally perceptible. A low level of sour acidic ﬂavor is acceptable when in balance with other components. These beers are often bottle conditioned and display some yeast character and high carbonation.
- **Body:** Low to medium
- **Additional notes:** Contemporary Specialty Saison represent a very wide family of specialty beers. Ingredients including spices, herbs, ﬂowers, fruits, vegetables, fermentable sugars and carbohydrates, special yeasts of all types, wood aging, etc. may contribute unique attributes to these beers. Earthy, cellar-like and/or musty aromas are acceptable. Color, body, malt character, esters, alcohol level and hop character should harmonize with attributes from special ingredients. _When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients such as malts and grains, hop varieties, microflora, fruit, spices, or other ingredients, etc. or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes._
