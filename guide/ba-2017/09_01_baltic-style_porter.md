# Baltic-Style Porter

- **Color:** Very deep ruby/garnet to black
- **Clarity:** Often opaque. When clarity is perceivable, chill haze should not be present.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Malt sweetness is medium-low to medium-high. Distinctive malt aromas and flavors of caramelized sugars, dark sugars and licorice along with chocolate character of roasted malts are present. Roasted dark malts may contribute coffee character but there should be no bitter or astringent flavors. Debittered roast malts are best used for this style.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Very low. Floral hop aroma can complement aromatics.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low to medium-low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Due to its alcoholic strength, there may be very low to low levels of complex alcohol aromas and ï¬‚avors and/or higher levels of fruitiness suggestive of berries, grapes and plums, but not banana. Fruity-estery aromas and flavors from warm fermentation is not appropriate. Diacetyl and DMS should not be apparent.
- **Body:** Medium to full
- **Additional notes:** Baltic Porter is brewed with lager yeast and fermented and lagered cold producing a smooth beer
