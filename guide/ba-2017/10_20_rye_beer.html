<h1>Rye Beer</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> A wide range of color is acceptable. Lighter versions are straw to copper, while darker versions are dark amber to dark brown.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Chill haze is acceptable in versions packaged and served without yeast. In versions served with yeast, appearance may range from hazy to very cloudy.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> In darker versions, malt aromas and ﬂavors can optionally include low roasted malt character expressed as cocoa/chocolate or caramel. Aromatic toffee, caramel, or biscuit character may also be present. Low level roastiness, graininess, or tannin astringency is acceptable when balanced with low to medium malt sweetness.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Low to medium-high</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Low levels of spicy, fruity-estery aromas are typical. Yeast-derived aromas and flavors such as phenolic, clove-like may be present when consistent with underlying beer style. These beers can be fermented with either ale or lager yeast. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Low to medium yeast aroma may be present in versions packaged with yeast.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Low to medium</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> The grist should include sufﬁcient rye so that rye character is evident in the beer. Beers brewed with rye that do not exhibit rye character would be categorized in other beer styles. Rye character is often described as slightly spicy and subtly black pepper-like. Versions served with yeast should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel. <em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other factors which influence perceived sensory outcomes.</em></li>
</ul>
