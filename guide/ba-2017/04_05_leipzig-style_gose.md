- **Clarity:** Cloudy or hazy from yeast
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not perceived
- **Perceived bitterness:** Not perceived
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Traditional examples of Gose are spontaneously fermented. Low to medium lactic acid character should be evident and expressed as a sharp, refreshing sourness. Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by _Brettanomyces_ may be evident but should have a very low proﬁle as these beers are not excessively aged.
- **Body:** Low to medium-low
- **Additional notes:** These beers typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, and may contain oats. Lemon or other citrus ﬂavors are often present. Some versions may have the spicy ﬂavor of coriander at low to medium levels. In traditional versions, small additions of salt may be perceivable at low levels. _When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include whether coriander, salt and/or Brettanomyces is used and/or other information about the brewing process._
