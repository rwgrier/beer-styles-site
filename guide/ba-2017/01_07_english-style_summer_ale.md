# English-Style Summer Ale

- **Color:** Pale to light amber
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Residual malt sweetness is low to medium. Torriﬁed or malted wheat is often used in quantities of 25 percent or less. Malt ﬂavor may be biscuity.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** English, American or noble-type hop aroma should be low to medium. English, American or noble-type hop ﬂavor should not be assertive and should be well balanced with malt character.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium-low to medium
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Low to moderate fruity-estery character is acceptable. No diacetyl or DMS character should be apparent.
- **Body:** Low to medium-low
- **Additional notes:** The overall impression is refreshing and thirst quenching
