<h1>Belgian-Style Gueuze Lambic</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Gold to medium amber</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Cloudiness is acceptable, as Gueuze is always bottle conditioned.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Sweet malt character is not perceived</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Not perceived to very low, and can include a cheesy or ﬂoral lavender character.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Very low</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Gueuze is characterized by intense fruity-estery, sour, and acidic aromas and ﬂavors. Diacetyl character should be absent. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic aromas and ﬂavors derived from Brettanomyces yeast are often present at moderate levels. Old Lambic is blended with newly fermenting young Lambic to create this special style of Lambic. These unﬂavored blended and secondary fermented Lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet and are characterized by intense fruity-estery, sour, and acidic ﬂavors. Vanillin and other wood-derived ﬂavors should not be evident. Carbonation can be none (flat) to medium.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Very low with dry mouthfeel</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Gueuze Lambics, whose origin is the Brussels area of Belgium, are often simply called Gueuze Lambic. Versions of this beer style made outside of the Brussels area are said to be “Belgian-Style Gueuze Lambics.” The Belgian-style versions are made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional Gueuze Lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or other sweeteners. Traditionally, Gueuze is brewed with unmalted wheat, malted barley, and stale, aged hops. Some modern versions may have a degree of sweetness contributed by sugars or other sweeteners. See also Belgian-Style Lambic for additional background information.</li>
