# Belgian-Style Table Beer

- **Color:** Gold to black. Caramel color is sometimes added to adjust color.
- **Clarity:** Beer color may be too dark to perceive. When clarity is perceivable, chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Mild malt character might be evident
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not perceived to very low
- **Perceived bitterness:** Very low to low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Diacetyl character should not be perceived. Traditional versions do not use artiÔ¨Åcial sweeteners nor are they excessively sweet. More modern versions can incorporate sweeteners such as sugar and saccharine added post fermentation for additional sweetness and to increase smoothness.
- **Body:** Low
- **Additional notes:** These beers may contain malted barley, wheat, and rye as well as unmalted wheat, rye, oats and corn. Though not common, flavorings such as coriander or orange and lemon peel are sometimes added, but are barely perceptible. The mouthfeel is light to moderate, and sometimes boosted with unfermented sugars/malt sugars. Low carbonation and aftertaste are typical.
