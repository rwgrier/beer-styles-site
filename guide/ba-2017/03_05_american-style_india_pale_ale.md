# American-Style India Pale Ale

- **Color:** Gold to copper
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Hop haze is allowable at any temperature.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Medium maltiness is present in aroma and ﬂavor
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Hop aroma and ﬂavor is high, exhibiting ﬂoral, fruity (berry, tropical, stone fruit and other), sulfur/diesel-like, onion-garlic-catty, citrusy, piney or resinous character that was originally associated with American-variety hops. Hops with these attributes now also originate from countries other than the USA.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium-high to very high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity-estery aroma and flavor may be low to high. Diacetyl should not be perceived.
- **Body:** Medium
- **Additional notes:** The use of water with high mineral content may result in a crisp, dry beer rather than a malt-accentuated version. Hops of varied origins may be used for bitterness or for approximating traditional American character.
