Hops of varied origins may be used for bitterness or for approximating traditional American character. Versions of this style brewed with non-traditional yeasts, fruits, spices, or other flavorings are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ales. Versions of this style brewed with darker malts, may be categorized as Experimental India Pale Ales, or possibly as American-Style Black Ale.<br/>
