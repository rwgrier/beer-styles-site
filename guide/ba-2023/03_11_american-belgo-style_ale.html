<h1>American-Belgo-Style Ale</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Gold to black</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Should conform the base beer style</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Typically low. Perception of specialty or roasted malts or barley can be very low to robust in darker versions.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Medium to very high, exhibiting American-type hop aromas not usually found in traditional Belgian styles.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Medium to high, in alignment with base beer style.</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Fruity esters are medium to high. Belgian yeast attributes such as banana, berry, apple, coriander, spice or smoky- phenolic should be in balance with malt and hops. Diacetyl, sulfur, and attributes typical of <em>Brettanomyces</em> should not be present.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Medium-low to medium, in alignment with base beer style.</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> American-Belgo-Style Ales are either 1) non-Belgian beer types portraying the unique characters imparted by yeasts typically used in big, fruity Belgian-style ales, or 2) defined Belgian- style beers displaying the hallmark attributes typical of American variety hops. These beers are unique unto themselves. <br/>
<em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes. Competition organizers may create subcategories which reflect groups of entries based on color, hop varieties, or underlying beer styles.</em></li>
</ul>
