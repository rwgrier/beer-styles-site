<h1>Belgian-Style Session Ale</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> May vary widely</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Very low to low, exhibiting a wide range of malt-derived attributes</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Very low to low, exhibiting a wide range of hop-derived attributes</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Very low to low but sufficient to balance other attributes</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Phenolic spiciness may be absent or may be present at low levels. Fruity-ester complexity may range from low to medium, in harmony with malt and other attributes. Diacetyl should not be present.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Very low to low</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Beers in this category recognize the uniqueness and traditions of Belgian brewing, but do not hew to any other Belgian-style categories defined in these guidelines. The most notable characteristic that these beers share is a modest alcohol content ranging from 2.1% - 5% abv. These beers can be lower gravity formulations of their own, or can be produced from second run wort from the production of higher gravity beers. Balance is a key component when assessing these beers. Wood-aged or fruited versions will exhibit attributes of wood- aging or fruit(s) in harmony with overall flavor profile. <br/>
<em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include an underlying Belgian beer style not otherwise defined in these guidelines or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients (fruit(s), etc.) or processing (wood-aging, etc.) which influence perceived sensory outcomes.</em></li>
