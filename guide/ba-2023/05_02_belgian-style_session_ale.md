- **Additional notes:** Beers in this category recognize the uniqueness and traditions of Belgian brewing, but do not hew to any other Belgian-style categories defined in these guidelines. The most notable characteristic that these beers share is a modest alcohol content ranging from 2.1% - 5% abv. These beers can be lower gravity formulations of their own, or can be produced from second run wort from the production of higher gravity beers. Balance is a key component when assessing these beers. Wood-aged or fruited versions will exhibit attributes of wood- aging or fruit(s) in harmony with overall flavor profile. <br/>
_When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include an underlying Belgian beer style not otherwise defined in these guidelines or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients (fruit(s), etc.) or processing (wood-aging, etc.) which influence perceived sensory outcomes._
