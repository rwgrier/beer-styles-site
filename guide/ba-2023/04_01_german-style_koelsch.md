# German-Style Koelsch

- **Color:** Straw to gold
- **Clarity:** Chill haze should not be present
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Malt character is very low to low with soft sweetness. Caramel character should not be present.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Low and, if present, should express noble hop character.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium to medium-high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity esters are absent to low, expressed as pear, apple, or wine-like attributes when present. Diacetyl should not be present.
- **Body:** Low to medium-low. Dry and crisp.
- **Additional notes:** Traditional examples often display persistent head retention. Small amounts of wheat can be used in brewing beers of this style.

Ale yeast is used for fermentation. Lager yeast is sometimes used for bottle conditioning or final cold conditioning.
