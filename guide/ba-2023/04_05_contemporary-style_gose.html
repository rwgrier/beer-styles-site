<h1>Contemporary-Style Gose</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Usually straw to medium amber and can take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients such as darker malts.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Clear to hazy. Haze may or may not result from yeast</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Malt aroma and flavor is not present to very low</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Very low to low</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Not present to medium</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Horsey, leathery, or earthy aromas contributed by <em>Brettanomyces</em> yeasts may be present but at low levels as these beers do not undergo prolonged aging. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Alternatively, they may be spontaneously fermented. Low to medium lactic acid character is present in all examples expressed as a sharp, refreshing sourness.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Low to medium-low</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Contemporary-style Gose may be brewed with malted or unmalted barley, wheat, and oats. Contemporary examples may also contain other grains. As in traditional examples, low level salt (table salt) and coriander additions may or may not be present in Contemporary Gose. Attributes from the use of a wide variety of herbs, spices, flowers, fruits, or other ingredients not found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose may also be present and in harmony with overall flavor profile. <br/>
<em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include any herbs, spices, fruit, or other added ingredients, and information about the brewing process.</em></li>
