# Bamberg-Style Weiss Rauchbier

- **Color:** Pale to chestnut brown
- **Clarity:** If served with yeast, appearance may be very cloudy.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** In darker versions, a detectable degree of roast malt may be present without being aggressive. Smoky malt aroma and flavor, ranging from low to high, should be present. Smoke character should be smooth, not harshly phenolic, suggesting a mild sweetness.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not present
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** The aroma and flavor of a Weiss Rauchbier with yeast should be fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove, nutmeg, vanilla, and smoke. Banana esters are often present at low to medium- high levels. No diacetyl should be perceived. Weissbiers are well attenuated and very highly carbonated.
- **Body:** Medium to full
- **Additional notes:** Beers in this style are made with at least 50 percent wheat malt. They are often roused during pouring, and, when yeast is present, will have a yeasty flavor and a fuller mouthfeel.
