<h1>Herb and Spice Beer</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Varies depending on underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Clear to hazy is acceptable</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Varies depending on intention of brewer, underlying beer style, and intensity of herb or spice aroma attributes</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Not essential but may be present and may be more assertive than herb-spice character</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Very low to medium-low. Reduced hop bitterness tends to accentuate herb/spice character.</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Aromas and flavors of individual spices may not always be identifiable</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Varies with underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Herb and Spice beer is any beer brewed with herbs or spices derived from leaves, roots, seeds, fruits, vegetables, flowers, etc. and which exhibits herbal or spicy attributes. Herb or spice character can range from subtle to intense. Classifying these beers can be complex. Beers which exhibit herbal or spicy character are considered Herb and Spice Beer. Beers brewed with chili peppers are categorized as Chili Pepper Beer. Beers brewed with or without pumpkin in which herb or spice attributes typical of pumpkin pie dominate are categorized as Pumpkin Spice Beer.<br/>
<em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as type or form of herb(s) or spice(s) used or other factors which influence perceived sensory outcomes.</em></li>
