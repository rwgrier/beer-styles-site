<h1>American-Style Fruited Sour Ale</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Can range from pale to black depending on underlying beer style and is often influenced by the color of added fruit</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Chill haze, bacteria, and yeast-induced haze is acceptable at any temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Low. In darker versions, any of roasted malt, caramel, or chocolate aroma and flavor attributes should be present at low levels.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> None to high</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> None to high and in balance with fruit character</li>
<li><p><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Moderate to intense, yet balanced, fruity esters are present. Diacetyl, DMS, and <em>Brettanomyces</em> should not be present. The evolution of natural acidity at medium-low to high levels develops a balanced complexity and is expressed as a refreshing, pleasant sourness, in harmony with other attributes. The acidity present is usually in the form of lactic, acetic, and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in kettle or post wort fermentation and is produced by various microorganisms, including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and attributes of age. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood- derived flavors such as vanillin should not be present. Attributes arising from liquids previously aged in a barrel, such as bourbon or sherry, should not be present.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Body:</strong> Low to high</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Fruit aromas, ranging from subtle to intense, should be present. Fruit or fruit extracts, used as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, provide harmonious fruit character ranging from subtle to intense. Beers exhibiting wood-derived attributes or evidence of liquids previously aged in wood are categorized as Fruited Wood-Aged Sour Beer. Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is defined as a vegetable, and beers containing coconut are categorized as Field Beer. Likewise beers containing chili peppers are categorized as Chili Beer. Fruited versions of Berliner-Style Weisse and Belgian-Style Sour Ale are categorized elsewhere. <br/>
<em>Competition organizers may create subcategories which reflect groups of entries based on color, hop varieties, microflora, spices, or other ingredients, etc. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes.</em></p></li>
