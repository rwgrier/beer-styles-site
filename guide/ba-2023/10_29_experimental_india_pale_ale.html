<h1>Experimental India Pale Ale</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Straw to very dark, varying widely with ingredients used</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> May range from clear to very high degree of cloudiness. Starch, yeast, hop, protein, and other compounds can contribute to a wide range of hazy appearance within this category</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Very low to medium-low malt aroma and flavor may be present, and may exhibit attributes typical of various adjuncts and specialty malts</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Medium to very high hop aroma and flavor are present, with attributes typical of hops from any origin</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Low to very high</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Fruity esters are low to high and may contribute to an overall highly fruity impression regardless of the presence or absence of fruit(s) used and can contribute to the perception of sweetness and be complementary to the hop profile. Yeast choices can vary widely as can sensory outcomes; very low to low phenolic or other attributes typical of wine, champagne or <em>Brettanomyces</em> yeast strains may be present but are not required. Carbonation can range from average to high, with higher levels often associated with a crisp mouthfeel. Diacetyl and DMS should not be present.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Very low to medium, depending on grist and yeast choice, enzymatic treatment, finishing adjunct(s) and other fermentation parameters. Mouthfeel can vary widely from light to full and from dry to silky.</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Beers in this category recognize the cutting edge of IPA brewing around the world. Experimental India Pale Ales are either 1) any of White, Red, Brown, Brut (fermented with champagne yeasts), Brett (fermented with <em>Brettanomyces</em>), Lager (fermented with lager yeasts), or many other IPA or Imperial IPA types or combinations thereof currently in production, and fruited or spiced versions of these, or 2) fruited, spiced, field (flavored with vegetables other than chili peppers), wood- and barrel-aged, or other elaborated versions of classic American, Juicy or Hazy, Imperial, British, or any other IPA categories. They range widely in color, hop, and malt intensity and attributes, hop bitterness, balance, alcohol content, body, and overall flavor experience. Dark versions of India Pale Ale that do not meet the specifications for American-Style Black Ale may be considered Experimental India Pale Ale. Fruited and spiced versions exhibit attributes typical of those ingredients, in harmony with hop impression and overall flavor experience. Lactose may be used to enhance body and balance, but should not lend to, or overwhelm, the flavor character of these beers. Classifying these beers can be complex. India Pale Ales brewed with honey are categorized here. Spiced or fruited versions of these beers, or those made with unusual fermentables or honey, are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale. India Pale Ales flavored with nuts, coconut or other vegetables are categorized here rather than as Field Beers. However, within the framework of these guidelines, all beers brewed with chili peppers are categorized as Chili Beers; India Pale Ale brewed w/ chili peppers in any form are categorized as Chili Beer.<br/>
<em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes.</em></li>
