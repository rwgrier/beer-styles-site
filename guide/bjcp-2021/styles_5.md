# Color Reference

_Note that SRM is a measure of beer color density more than hue, tint, or shade. Keep this in mind when attempting to use only SRM numbers when describing beers. Within these Guidelines, beer color descriptors generally <u>approximate</u> this mapping to SRM values:_

Straw	2-3
Yellow	3-4
Gold	5-6
Amber	6-9
Deep amber/light copper	10-14
Copper	14-17
Deep copper/light brown	17-18
Brown	19-22
Dark Brown	22-30
Very Dark Brown	30-35
Black	30+
Black, opaque	40+

Do not be overly pedantic about ascribing perceived color names to SRM references, as viewing conditions often greatly influence this perception, individual perceptions vary, and hues outside of the yellow-to- brown spectrum can skew results. In the event of apparent contradictions, favor the named descriptions over the numbers.
