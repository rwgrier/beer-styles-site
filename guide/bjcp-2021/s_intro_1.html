<h1>INTRODUCTION TO SPECIALTY-TYPE BEER</h1>

<p><em><strong>Specialty-Type Beer</strong> is a broad term referring to style Categories 28 through 34, and is in contrast to the <strong>Classic Style</strong> beers of Categories 1 through 27. The Classic Styles are complete, standalone descriptions, but Specialty-Type styles involve a transformation of a Base Style using either a process or by adding one or more <strong>Specialty-Type Ingredients</strong> (yeast/bacteria, smoke, wood, fruit, spice, grain, or sugar). Specialty-Type Beer style descriptions usually describe how the Specialty-Type Ingredients or processes modify the Base Style.</em></p>

<p><em>When a <strong>Base Style</strong> for Specialty-Type Beers is required, either a Classic Style or a broad style family (e.g., IPA, Blond Ale, Stout) may be used. In general, Specialty-Type beers may not be used as a Base Style for other Specialty-Type beers unless the Entry Instructions for the style specifically allow it. A few Specialty-Type Beer styles do not require a Base Style to be declared â€“ read the Entry Instructions section of each style description carefully.</em></p>

<p><em>Consult the Provisional Styles page on the BJCP website for additions to the master list of styles. These Provisional Styles can be cited as a Base Style when entering a Specialty-Type Beer. The Style Entry Suggestions page on the BJCP website clarifies where to enter some currently undefined styles.</em></p>

<p><em>In general, when submitting a Specialty-Type Beer with a food-type ingredient, use the culinary rather than the botanical definition of ingredients. See the preamble in each style category for a detailed list of common ingredients.</em></p>

<p><em>This introduction section is assumed to be incorporated into every Specialty-Type Beer style description. It describes in general how to enter and judge a Specialty-Type Beer. Specific Entry Instructions for each style are contained within individual style descriptions.</em></p>
