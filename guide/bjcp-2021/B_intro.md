# APPENDIX B: LOCAL STYLES

_This appendix contains style descriptions submitted by local BJCP judges or brewers within a single country or region for emerging styles of local importance that may or may not have wider popularity. The BJCP has reviewed, edited, and verified the style descriptions, which may be used by anyone, not just as an appellation in the local area (although judges outside the area may not be familiar with them). These local styles are part of the Style Guidelines, and are not provisional styles._
