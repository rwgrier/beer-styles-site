<h1>31B. Alternative Sugar Beer</h1>

<p><em>An <strong>Alternative Sugar Beer</strong> is a standard beer (Classic Style or not) with added sweeteners, including fermentable sugars (e.g., honey, brown sugar, invert sugar, molasses, treacle, maple syrup, sorghum), unfermentable sugars (e.g., lactose), sugar alcohols (e.g., sorbitol), and any other sweetener (natural or artificial) that affects the flavor profile. The beers may or may not have any residual sweetness; it depends on the type of sugar, but flavor contributions are expected.</em></p>

<h2>Overall Impression:</h2>

<p>A tasteful integration of sugar and beer, but still recognizable as beer. The sugar character should both be evident and in balance with the beer, not so forward as to suggest an artificial product. </p>

<h2>Aroma:</h2>

<p>Same as the base beer, except that some additional fermentables (e.g., honey, molasses) may add an aroma, which should be a pleasant, balanced combination with the beer.</p>

<h2>Appearance:</h2>

<p>Same as the base beer, although some sugars will bring additional, usually darker, colors.</p>

<h2>Flavor:</h2>

<p>Same as the base beer, except that some additional fermentables (e.g., honey, molasses) may add a flavor, which should be a pleasant, balanced combination with the beer. Added sugars should not have a raw, unfermented flavor. Some unfermentable sugars provide a fuller finish, while fully fermentable sugars can thin out the finish. </p>

<h2>Mouthfeel:</h2>

<p>Same as the base beer, although depending on the type of sugar added, could increase or decrease the body.</p>

<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>The additional sugar should be apparent somewhere in the sensory profile. If the sugars do not add a distinguishable character to the beer, enter it in the base style category. A honey-based beer should not have so much honey that it is perceived more like a mead with beer (i.e., a braggot) than a honey beer. This style should not be used for styles where the alternative sugar is fundamental to the style definition, or where a small amount of neutral-flavored sugar is used simply to increase gravity, increase attenuation, or lighten flavor or body; those beers should be entered as the normal base style.</p>

<h2>Entry Instructions:</h2>

<p>The entrant <strong>must</strong> specify the type of sugar used. Entrant <strong>must</strong> specify a description of the beer, identifying <strong>either</strong> a Base Style <strong>or</strong> the ingredients, specs, or target character of the beer. A general description of the special nature of the beer can cover all the required items.</p>

<h2>Vital Statistics:</h2>

<p>OG, FG, IBUs, SRM, and ABV will vary depending on the underlying base beer.</p>

<h2>Commercial Examples:</h2>

<p>Bellâ€™s Hopslam, Cervejaria Colorado Appia, Fifth Hammer Break of Jawn, Groundswell Piloncillo, Long Trail Harvest, New Glarus Cabin Fever</p>
