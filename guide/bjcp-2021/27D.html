<h1>Historical Beer: London Brown Ale</h1>

<h2>Overall Impression:</h2>

<p>A luscious, sweet, malty, low-alcohol dark brown ale, with caramel and toffee malt complexity and a sweet-tasting finish.</p>

<h2>Aroma:</h2>

<p>Moderate malty-sweet aroma, often with a rich, caramel, or toffee-like character. Low to medium fruity esters, often dark fruit like plums. Very low earthy or floral hop aroma optional.</p>

<h2>Appearance:</h2>

<p>Medium to very dark brown color, but can be almost black. Nearly opaque, although should be relatively clear if visible. Low to moderate off-white to tan head.</p>

<h2>Flavor:</h2>

<p>Deep, caramel or toffee sweet malty flavor on the palate, lasting into the finish, often with hints of biscuit and coffee. Some dark fruit esters can be present; relatively clean fermentation profile for an English ale. Low bitterness. Low earthy or floral hop flavor optional, but rare. Moderately-low roasty or bitter black malt flavor optional. Moderately sweet finish with a smooth, malty aftertaste. May have a sugary-sweet flavor. </p>

<h2>Mouthfeel:</h2>

<p>Medium body, but the residual sweetness may give a heavier impression. Medium-low to medium carbonation. Quite creamy and smooth in texture, particularly for its gravity.</p>

<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>Increasingly rare; Mann’s has over 90% market share in Britain, but in a vanishingly small segment. Always bottled. Frequently used as a sweet mixer with cask mild and bitter in pubs. Commercial versions can be pasteurized and back-sweetened, which gives more of a sugary-sweet flavor.</p>

<h2>History:</h2>

<p>Developed by Mann’s as a bottled product in 1902. Claimed at the time to be “the sweetest beer in London.” Pre-WWI versions were around 5% ABV, but same general balance. Declined in popularity in second half of 20th century, and now nearly extinct.</p>

<h2>Characteristic Ingredients:</h2>

<p>English pale ale malt as a base with a large proportion of darker caramel malts and often some black and wheat malts (this is Mann’s traditional grist – others can rely on dark sugars for color and flavor). Moderate to high carbonate water. English hops. Post-fermentation sweetening with lactose or artificial sweeteners, or sucrose, if pasteurized.</p>

<h2>Style Comparison:</h2>

<p>May seem somewhat like a less roasty version of a Sweet Stout (and lower-gravity, at least for US sweet stout examples) or a sweet version of a Dark Mild.</p>

<h2>Vital Statistics:</h2>

<ul>
<li>OG:   1.033 – 1.038 </li>
<li>FG:   1.012 – 1.015</li>
<li>IBUs: 15 – 20   </li>
<li>SRM:  22 – 35   </li>
<li>ABV:  2.8 – 3.6%</li>
</ul>

<h2>Commercial Examples:</h2>

<p>Harveys Bloomsbury Brown Ale, Mann's Brown Ale</p>
