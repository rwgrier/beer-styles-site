# 34C. Experimental Beer

_This is explicitly a catch-all category for any beer that does not fit into an Existing Style description. No beer is ever “out of style” in this style, unless it can be entered in another beer style first. This is the last resort for any beer entered into a competition. With the broad definition for previous styles, this style should be rarely used._

## Overall Impression: 

Varies, but should be a unique experience.

## Aroma: 

Varies.

## Appearance:

## Flavor: 

Varies.

## Mouthfeel: 

Varies.

## Comments: 

This style cannot represent a well-known commercial beer (otherwise it would be a Commercial Specialty Beer) and cannot fit into any other existing Specialty-Type Beer style (including those within this major category).

## Entry Instructions: 

The entrant **must** specify the special nature of the experimental beer, including the special ingredients or processes that make it not fit elsewhere in the guidelines. The entrant **must** provide vital statistics for the beer, **and** either a brief sensory description or a list of ingredients used in making the beer. _Without this information, judges will have no basis for evaluation._

## Vital Statistics: 

OG, FG, IBUs, SRM, and ABV will vary depending on the declared beer.

## Commercial Examples: 

None
