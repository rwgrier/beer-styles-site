# Judging Specialty-Type Beers

_Judges should read and understand the directions given to entrants in the Entering Specialty-Type Beers section._

Overall balance and drinkability are the critical success factors for a Specialty-Type Beer. The entry should be a coherent fusion of the beer with the special ingredients, with neither overpowering the other. 

Special ingredients should complement and enhance the underlying beer, and the resulting product should be pleasant to drink. The beer should contain recognizable components meeting entry requirements for the style, bearing in mind that some beers may fit in multiple styles.

Judges should be aware that a creative element exists in brewing these styles, and that strange-sounding combinations should not be prejudiced. Keep an open mind because some unusual flavor pairings can be surprisingly delicious. Unusual does not necessarily mean better, however. Taste should always be the final deciding factor, not perceived creativity, difficulty in brewing, or rarity of ingredients.

## Overall Assessment

Experienced judges will often first taste Specialty-Type Beers for overall drinking pleasure prior to assessing details. This quick assessment is designed to detect whether the combination works or doesn’t. If the beer has flavor clashes, it won’t be enjoyable regardless of its technical merit. 

The old proverb about _not missing the forest for the trees_ is quite applicable. Do not judge these styles as rigidly as Classic Styles, as you might miss the successful synergy of ingredients. 

## Base Style

Judges should not be overly pedantic about seeking the full character of a specified Base Style beer. After all, the base beer does not usually contain the special ingredient, so the sensory character will not be the same as in the original beer. There can be interactions of flavor that produce additional sensory effects. 

Judges should also understand that the fermentation process can transform some ingredients (particularly those with fermentable sugars), and that the special ingredient character in the beer may not be perceived the same as the specialty ingredient itself. Therefore, judges should look for the overall agreeability and balance of the resulting combination, as long as the beer suggests both the Base Style and the Specialty-Type Ingredient or process.

## Multiple Ingredients

Judges do not need to taste every individual Specialty-Type Ingredient (such as spices) when multiple are declared. Often it is the resulting combination that contributes to a greater character, so allow for these ingredients to be used in varying intensities to produce a more pleasant tasting experience.

Not every beer will fit a style perfectly. Some beers with multiple ingredients could be entered as several styles. Be lenient when evaluating these beers. Reward those beers that are well-made and are pleasant to drink rather than lecturing the entrant about where they should have entered it.

If an entrant declares a potential allergen in the beer, do not deduct points if you cannot perceive it.

## Balance Effects of Specialty-Type Ingredients

The Specialty-Type Ingredient character should be pleasant and supportive, not artificial or inappropriately overpowering, taking into account that some ingredients have an inherently prominent character. Aroma hops, fermentation byproducts, and malt components of the underlying beer may not be as noticeable when additional ingredients are present, and they may also be intentionally subdued to allow the ingredient character to be perceived more clearly in the final presentation. 

Hop aroma may be absent or balanced with the added ingredients, depending on the style. The added ingredients should add an extra complexity to the beer, but not be so prominent as to unbalance the resulting presentation.
