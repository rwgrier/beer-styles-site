<h1>5C. German Helles Exportbier</h1>

<h2>Overall Impression:</h2>

<p>A golden German lager balancing a smooth malty profile with a bitter, hoppy character in a slightly above-average body and strength beer. </p>

<h2>Aroma:</h2>

<p>Medium-low to medium floral, spicy, or herbal hop aroma. Moderate grainy-sweet malt aroma, possibly with light toasty, bready, or doughy notes. Clean fermentation profile. Hops and malt both noticeable, and generally balanced.</p>

<h2>Appearance:</h2>

<p>Medium yellow to deep gold. Clear. Persistent white head.</p>

<h2>Flavor:</h2>

<p>Moderate, balanced malt and hops with supporting bitterness. Malt and hop flavors similar to aroma (same descriptors and intensities). Medium, noticeable bitterness, full on the palate, with a medium-dry finish. Clean fermentation character. Aftertaste of both malt and hops, generally in balance. Mineral character typically perceived more as a roundness and fullness of flavor, and a dry, flinty sharpness in the finish rather than overt mineral flavors. Background sulfate optional.</p>

<h2>Mouthfeel:</h2>

<p>Medium to medium-full body. Medium carbonation. Smooth and mellow on the palate. Very slight warmth may be noted in stronger versions.</p>

<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>Also known Dortmunder Export, Dortmunder, Export, or simply a Dort. Called Export within Germany, and often Dortmunder elsewhere, Export is also a beer strength descriptor under German brewing tradition, and could be applied to other styles. Splits the difference between a German Pils and a Munich Helles in several aspects: color, hop-malt balance, finish, bitterness.</p>

<h2>History:</h2>

<p>Developed in Dortmund in the Ruhr industrial region in the 1870s in response to pale Pilsner-type beers. It became very popular after World War II but declined in the 1970s. Other Export-class beers developed independently, and reflected a slightly stronger version of existing beers.</p>

<h2>Characteristic Ingredients:</h2>

<p>Minerally water with high levels of sulfates, carbonates, and chlorides. Traditional German or Czech hops. Pilsner malt. German lager yeast. Decoction mash traditional.</p>

<h2>Style Comparison:</h2>

<p>Less finishing hops and more body than a German Pils. More bitter and drier than a Munich Helles. Stronger, drier, but less hoppy than a Czech Premium Pale Lager.</p>

<h2>Vital Statistics:</h2>

<ul>
<li>OG:   1.050 – 1.058</li>
<li>FG:   1.008 – 1.015</li>
<li>IBUs: 20 – 30   </li>
