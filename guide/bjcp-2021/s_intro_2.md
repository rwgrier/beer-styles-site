# Entering Specialty-Type Beers

Many brewers have questions about where to enter their specialty beers, and how best to describe them. Follow these suggestions for better results:

## Entry Instructions

Entering a Specialty-Type Beer in a competition requires more information than simply selecting the style. Examine the Entry Instruction section within the selected style description for the specific required information. Judges will expect this information, and they will not be able to judge your beer properly without it; your score will suffer if it is omitted.

When deciding what optional information to supply, imagine yourself in the position of the judge. Give them pertinent information that will help them understand your beer and your intent. Avoid useless, irrelevant information that does not help the judge understand your beer. Do not use puffery or marketing-type descriptions. Refrain from using any information that could allow judges to determine your identity. Some competition software artificially limits the length of comments, so choose your words carefully.

## Base Style

Most Specialty-Type Beers require either a Base Style to be identified, or at least a description of the beer – check the style’s _Entry Instructions_ for requirements. If a Base Style is required, use one of the named styles from Categories 1 through 27, including beers from styles or categories with enumerated alternatives (like Historical Beer or Specialty IPA). Provisional Styles from the BJCP website and Local Styles from the Appendix may also be used as a Base Style.

If the Entry Instructions say that a generic style family can be used, that means to state a broad style in the general sense – like IPA, Porter, or Stout. You are not required to pinpoint the specific type of Porter, for instance, but you should give a general description of the beer. Some beers that are designed to showcase a specialty ingredient have a fairly neutral base.

Do not use Specialty-Type Beers as a Base Style in other Specialty-Type Beer styles unless the Entry Instructions for that style specifically allow it. Many Specialty-Type style categories have a ‘Specialty’ style that allows for certain other Specialty-Type Ingredients. Otherwise, the 34B Mixed-Style Beer style can be used.

## Specialty Ingredients

The more specific or lavish you describe your specialty ingredient, the more judges will look for that character. Taste your beer, then highlight those ingredients that are identifiable. If only one Specialty-Type ingredient was used, it should contribute a recognizable character to the beer. If you mention multiple ingredients, they do not all need to be individually identifiable but they should contribute to the overall sensory experience.

If you mention an unusual ingredient, you may want to describe its character, or at least be sure that a web search on that name will produce a useful reference for the judge. Providing a search term is a good alternative.

A generic or simple name of an ingredient is often best, unless your specific ingredient has an uncommon profile. If you use a combination of ingredients, such as spices, you can often refer to the blend by its common name (e.g., pumpkin pie spice, curry powder) rather than the individual spices.

If you use an ingredient that is a potential allergen, always declare it as such even if it cannot be perceived. Example: “allergen: peanuts” – judges should not penalize a beer when a declared allergen cannot be detected.

## Best Fit

Placing a beer with a single Specialty-Type Ingredient and a Classic Base Style is obvious. Selecting the best style for a beer with a combination of Specialty-Type Ingredients takes some thought. When selecting a style in which to enter your Specialty-Type Beer, look for the _best fit_ from the possible alternatives where the combination of ingredients is allowed. Select a style representing the dominant ingredient, or if the ingredients are equally balanced, select the first Specialty-Type style where it qualifies.

Entering a beer in a Specialty-Type style is a signal to judges that your beer has certain identifiable elements. If you used an ingredient, but it cannot be perceived, then do not enter it in a style that requires the ingredient. If judges cannot detect it, they will believe it is absent and deduct points accordingly.
