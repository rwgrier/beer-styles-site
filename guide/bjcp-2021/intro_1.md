# INTRODUCTION TO THE 2021 GUIDELINES

_The 2021 BJCP Style Guidelines are a minor revision to the 2015 edition, itself a major update of the 2008 edition. The goals of the 2015 edition were to better address world beer styles as found in their local markets, keep pace with emerging craft beer market trends, describe historical beers now finding a following, better describe the sensory characteristics of modern brewing ingredients, take advantage of new research and references, and help competition organizers better manage the complexity of their events. These goals have not changed in the 2021 edition._

_In 2015, many styles were added, some styles were divided into multiple categories, and some simply renamed. Styles are organized into categories following a philosophy that groups styles with similar judging characteristics rather than a common heritage or family name. Do not assume that the same primary characteristic (e.g., color, strength, balance, dominant flavor, country of origin) was used to determine each category grouping â€“ the reasoning was more nuanced._

_If you are familiar with the 2015 guidelines, we have made a few name changes and some styles have moved from provisional, historical, or local styles into the main guidelines. We intentionally tried to keep style moves, style additions, and numbering changes to a minimum._
