# INTRODUCTION TO SPECIALTY-TYPE BEER

_**Specialty-Type Beer** is a broad term referring to style Categories 28 through 34, and is in contrast to the **Classic Style** beers of Categories 1 through 27. The Classic Styles are complete, standalone descriptions, but Specialty-Type styles involve a transformation of a Base Style using either a process or by adding one or more **Specialty-Type Ingredients** (yeast/bacteria, smoke, wood, fruit, spice, grain, or sugar). Specialty-Type Beer style descriptions usually describe how the Specialty-Type Ingredients or processes modify the Base Style._

_When a **Base Style** for Specialty-Type Beers is required, either a Classic Style or a broad style family (e.g., IPA, Blond Ale, Stout) may be used. In general, Specialty-Type beers may not be used as a Base Style for other Specialty-Type beers unless the Entry Instructions for the style specifically allow it. A few Specialty-Type Beer styles do not require a Base Style to be declared â€“ read the Entry Instructions section of each style description carefully._

_Consult the Provisional Styles page on the BJCP website for additions to the master list of styles. These Provisional Styles can be cited as a Base Style when entering a Specialty-Type Beer. The Style Entry Suggestions page on the BJCP website clarifies where to enter some currently undefined styles._

_In general, when submitting a Specialty-Type Beer with a food-type ingredient, use the culinary rather than the botanical definition of ingredients. See the preamble in each style category for a detailed list of common ingredients._

_This introduction section is assumed to be incorporated into every Specialty-Type Beer style description. It describes in general how to enter and judge a Specialty-Type Beer. Specific Entry Instructions for each style are contained within individual style descriptions._
