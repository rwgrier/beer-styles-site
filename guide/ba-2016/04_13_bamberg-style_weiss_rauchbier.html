<h1>Bamberg-Style Weiss Rauchbier</h1>

<p>Bamberg-Style Weiss Rauchbiers are a range of color from pale to chestnut brown. Because yeast is present appearance may appropriately be very cloudy. Smoky malt character ranging from low to high should be present in the aroma. The aroma of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-like, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like ester aroma is often present at low to medium-high levels. Hop aroma is not perceived. In darker versions a detectable degree of roast malt may be present without being robust. Smoky malt flavor ranging from low to high is present. Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is low. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat. No diacetyl should be perceived. The flavor of a Weissbier is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- like or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated. Body is medium to full. These beers are typically roused during pouring and because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel. <em>During competition, entries will be roused unless instructed otherwise by the entering brewer.</em></p>
