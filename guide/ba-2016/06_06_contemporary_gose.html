<h1>Contemporary Gose</h1>

<p>Contemporary Goses are straw to medium amber, or, may take on the hue of added fruits or other ingredients if present. Appearance is cloudy/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity aromas other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose are present, in harmony with other aromas. Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by <em>Brettanomyces</em> yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low. They typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional examples containing oats; contemporary examples may also contain other grains. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character and coriander are traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria, or may be spontaneously fermented. Contemporary Gose differs from Traditional Gose by the addition of fruits, spices, grains and other non-traditional ingredients. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Body is low to medium-low. <em>At competitions, brewers should provide supplemental information which can include any herbs, spices, fruit or other added ingredients, and/or information about the brewing process.</em></p>
