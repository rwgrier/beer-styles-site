<h1>Chocolate or Cocoa Beer</h1>

<p>Chocolate or Cocoa Beers are light amber to black depending on the underlying style. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Chocolate Beers are any beers using “dark” chocolate or cocoa in any of its forms other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct and balanced (ranging from subtle to intense) character. Hop aroma not perceived to very low. Medium-low to medium-high malt sweetness helps accent balanced cocoa flavors and aromas. Hop flavor lower than might be expected for style of beer. Under hopping allows chocolate to contribute to the flavor profile while not becoming excessively bitter. Hop bitterness is very low to medium-low. Other flavors may be infused but chocolate should be dominant character. Body is variable with style. Beers made with white chocolate do not exemplify this category. <em>If this beer is a classic style made with chocolate or cocoa, the brewer should specify the classic style.</em></p>
