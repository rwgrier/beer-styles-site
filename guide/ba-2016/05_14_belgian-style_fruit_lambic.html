<h1>Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic</h1>

<p>Belgian-Style Fruit Lambics are hued with color reflecting the choice of fruit. Cloudiness is acceptable. These beers, also known by the names framboise, kriek, peche, cassis, etc., are characterized by fruit aromas. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic aromas evolved from <em>Brettanomyces</em> yeast are often present at moderate levels. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is absent, but sweetness of fruit may be low to high. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is very low. Fruit lambics are characterized by fruit flavors. Sourness is an important part of the flavor profile, though sweetness may compromise the intensity. These flavored lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic flavors evolved from <em>Brettanomyces</em> yeast are often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be evident. Body is dry to full. Fruit Lambics whose origin is the Brussels area are often simply called fruit lambic. Versions of this beer style made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium are said to be <q>Belgian-Style Fruit Lambics.</q> The Belgian-style versions are made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners. See also Belgian-Style Lambic for additional background information. <em>Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.</em></p>
