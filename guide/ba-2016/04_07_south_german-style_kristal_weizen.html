<h1>South German-Style Kristal Weizen</h1>

<p>South German-Style Kristal Weizens are straw to amber. Appearance is clear with no chill haze present. Because the beer has been filtered, yeast is not present. The aroma is very similar to Hefeweizen; the phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-like or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like ester aroma is often present. Hop aroma is not perceived to very low. Malt sweetness is very low to medium-low. Hop flavor is not perceived to very low. Hop bitterness is very low. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat. No diacetyl should be perceived. The flavor is very similar to Hefeweizen with the caveat that fruity and phenolic characters are not combined with the yeasty flavor and fuller-bodied mouthfeel of yeast. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-like or nutmeg- like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like ester flavor is often present. Kristal Weizen is well attenuated and very highly carbonated. Body is medium to full. The beer will have no flavor of yeast and a cleaner, drier mouthfeel than counterparts served with yeast.</p>
