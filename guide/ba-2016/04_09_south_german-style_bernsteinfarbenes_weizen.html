<h1>South German-Style Bernsteinfarbenes Weizen</h1>

<p>South German-Style Bernsteinfarbenes Weizens are amber to light brown; the German word bernsteinfarben means amber colored. If served with yeast appearance may appropriately be very cloudy. The phenolic and estery aromas typical of Weissbiers are more subdued in Bernsteinfarbenes Weissbier. No diacetyl aroma should be perceived. Hop aroma is not perceived. Distinct sweet maltiness and caramel or bready character from the use of medium colored malts characterize this beer style. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is low. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat. The phenolic and estery flavors of this Weissbier should be evident but subdued. Bernsteinfarbenes Weissbier should be well attenuated and very highly carbonated. No diacetyl should be perceived. Body is medium to full. These beers are typically roused during pouring and because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel. <em>During competition, entries will be roused unless instructed otherwise by the entering brewer.</em></p>
