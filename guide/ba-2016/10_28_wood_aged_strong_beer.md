# Wood- and Barrel-Aged Strong Beer

Wood- and Barrel-Aged Strong Beers are any color. For purposes of competition these wood-aged beers contain alcohol greater than 5.2% abw or 6.5% abv. Any strong classic or unique experimental lager, ale or hybrid beer style, either a traditional style or unique experimental beers, can be aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. These beers are aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel; but, wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Wood-Aged Beers may or may not have _Brettanomyces_ character. Body is variable with style. For purposes of competition fruited or spiced strong beer that is wood and barrel aged would also be appropriately entered in this category. Sour wood- aged strong beers would more appropriately be characterized as Wood-Aged Sour Beer. _A statement provided by the brewer identifying a classic or other beer style, type and condition of wood, previous liquid in the barrel, and any other ingredients used is essential for accurate assessment at competitions._
