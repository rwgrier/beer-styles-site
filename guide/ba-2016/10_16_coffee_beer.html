<h1>Coffee Beer</h1>

<p>Coffee Beers are pale to black depending on the underlying style. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Coffee beers use coffee in any of its forms to create a distinct and balanced (ranging from subtle to intense) character. Hop aroma is low to high depending on the intent of the underlying style. Medium-low to medium malt sweetness helps accent balanced coffee flavor and aromas. Hop flavor is reflective of aroma and can be low to high depending on the intent of the underlying style. Hop bitterness is variable, depending on underlying beer style. Other flavors may be infused but coffee should be an obvious character. Body is reflective of the underlying beer style. <em>A statement by the brewer including information about the classic or experimental beer style and coffee used is essential in order for accurate assessment in competitions.</em></p>
