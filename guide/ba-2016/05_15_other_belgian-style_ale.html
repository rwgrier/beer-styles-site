<h1>Other Belgian-Style Ale</h1>

<p>Other Belgian-Style Ales are of varying color. Hop aroma is a wide range depending on style. Malt perception may also vary widely depending on style. Hop flavor is a wide range depending on style. Hop bitterness is a wide range depending on style. Recognizing the uniqueness and traditions of several other styles of Belgian Ales, the beers entered in this category will be assessed on the merits that they do not fit existing style guidelines, and information that the brewer provides explaining the history and tradition of the style. Balance of character is a key component when assessing these beers. Body is variable with style. <em>Barrel or wood-aged entries in competitions may be directed to other categories by competition director. In competitions the brewer must provide the historical or regional tradition of the style, or his interpretation of the style, in order to be assessed properly by the judges.</em></p>
