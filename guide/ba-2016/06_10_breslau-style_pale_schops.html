<h1>Breslau-Style Pale Schöps</h1>

<p>Traditional Pale Schöps are straw to light amber. They are made with a high proportion (as much as 80%) of pale wheat malt as well as pilsener and other pale specialty malts. They may have a bready, aromatic biscuit malt aroma, but not caramel. Fruity-ester aromas may be evident since this is a beer fermented with ale yeast. Traditional German wheat beer yeast is not used in this style of beer. Diacetyl and phenolic aromas should not be perceived. Hop aroma is very low. Pale Schöps has medium to medium- high malt sweetness. Hop flavor is low. Hop bitterness is perceived as medium-low to medium. Fruity-ester flavors may be present. Diacetyl and phenolic flavors should be absent. Body is full.</p>
