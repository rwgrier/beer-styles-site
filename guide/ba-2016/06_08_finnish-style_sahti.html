Malt aroma is medium-low to medium. Fruity-ester and yeasty aromas are medium to high. Juniper aroma is evident due to the use of juniper boughs/branches and berries in the brewing process. Diacetyl aroma should not be perceived. Hop aroma is not evident to very low. Malt flavor is overall sweet, medium to high. Hop flavor is not evident to very low. Hop bitterness is very low. Juniper flavor is evident. Bread/bakersâ€™ yeast is traditionally used for fermentation. Complex alcohols, clove-like phenols, banana fruitiness are byproducts evident in flavor and aromas due to type of yeast and fermentation regime. Diacetyl flavor should not be perceived.
