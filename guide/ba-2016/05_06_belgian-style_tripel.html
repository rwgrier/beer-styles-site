<h1>Belgian-Style Tripel</h1>

<p>Belgian-Style Tripels are pale to light-amber. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional tripels are bottle conditioned and may exhibit slight yeast haze, but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. A complex, sometimes mild spicy aroma characterizes this style. Clove-like phenolic aroma may be very low. Fruity-ester aromas including banana are also common but not necessary. Hop aroma is low if present. Low sweetness from very pale malts is present. Character from roasted or any dark malts should not be present. Hop flavor is low if present. Hop bitterness is medium to medium-high. Complex sometimes mild spicy flavor characterizes this style. Clove-like phenolic flavor may be evident at very low levels. Fruity- ester flavors including banana are also common but not necessary. Traditional Tripels are often well attenuated. Body is medium. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Hop/malt balance is equalizing. The overall beer flavor may finish sweet, though any sweet finish should be light. Oxidative character if evident in aged tripels should be mild and pleasant.</p>
