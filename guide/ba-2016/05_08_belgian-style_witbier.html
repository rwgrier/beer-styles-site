<h1>Belgian-Style Witbier</h1>

<p>Belgian-Style Witbiers are straw to pale. Unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. Wits are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. Coriander and light orange peel aroma should be perceived as such or as an unidentified spiciness. Low to medium fruity-ester aromas are present. Diacetyl aroma should not be perceived. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt character is very low to low. Hop flavor is not perceived to low. Hop bitterness is low, achieved traditionally by the use of noble- type hops. Wits are spiced with coriander and orange peel. Mild phenolic spiciness and yeast flavors may be evident. Low to medium fruity-ester flavors are present. Mild acidity is appropriate. No diacetyl flavor should be perceived. Wits are brewed using unmalted wheat, sometimes oats and malted barley. Body is low to medium, with a degree of creaminess from wheat starch. <em>During competition, entries will be roused unless instructed otherwise by the entering brewer. During registration brewers may specify pouring instructions, choosing intentional rousing of yeast, normal pouring or quiet pouring. Entries will be presented during judging as specified by entering brewer.</em></p>
