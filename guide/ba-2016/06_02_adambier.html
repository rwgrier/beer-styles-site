<h1>Adambier</h1>

<p>Adambiers are light brown to very dark. Toast and caramel-like malt aroma may be evident. Hop aroma is low. Astringency of highly roasted malt should be absent. Toast and caramel-like malt flavors may be evident. Hop flavor is low. Hop bitterness is low to medium. Adambier may or may not use wheat in its formulation. Traditional and non-hybrid varieties of European hops were traditionally used. A KoÌˆlsch-like ale fermentation is typical. Extensive aging and acidification of this beer can mask malt and hop character to varying degrees. Aging in barrels may contribute some level of <em>Brettanomyces</em> and lactic character. Body is medium to full. The style originated in Dortmund, and is a strong, dark, hoppy sour ale extensively aged in wood barrels. Traditional versions may have a low or medium low degree of smokiness. Smoke character may be absent in contemporary versions. For purposes of this competition, fruited versions would more appropriately be entered as Fruited Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer.</p>
