<h1>Session Beer</h1>

<p>Session Beers are the color of the classic beer style being made to lower strength. Appearance may vary from brilliant to hazy to cloudy with style of beer being made to lower strength. Aroma depends on the style of beer being made to lower strength. Any style of beer can be made lower in strength than described in the classic style guidelines. The goal should be to reach a balance between the style's character and the lower alcohol content. Drinkability is a character in the overall balance of these beers. Beers in this category must not exceed 4.0% alcohol by weight (5.0% alcohol by volume). Beers above these limits that are entered into this category may be disqualified before judging or after results are announced. Body is variable with style. <em>Beers which exceed 5.0% abv would not be characterized as Session Beer. Beers containing less than 4.0% abw (5.0% abv) which could be appropriately characterized in another classic or traditional category would not be appropriately characterized as Session Beer. At competition Session IPAs would be appropriately characterized as Session India Pale Ale, if such a category exists.</em></p>
