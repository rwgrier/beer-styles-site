# Herb and Spice Beer

Herb and Spice Beers are any range of color depending on underlying style. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Herb and Spice beers are any beers using herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense). Individual aroma and/or flavor characters of herbs and/or spices used may not always be identifiable but should be evident. Hop aroma is not essential but may be evident in certain herbed/spiced beer styles and may or may not dominate over herb-spice character. Malt sweetness will vary dramatically depending on overall balance desired. Hop flavor is not essential but may be evident in certain herbed/spiced beer styles and may or may not dominate over herb-spice character. Hop bitterness is very low to medium-low. The perception of lower hop bitterness is optimal for highlighting herbal/spice characters. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Body is variable with style. Classifying these beers can be complex; entries which exhibit primarily herbal and/or spicy qualities would appropriately considered as Herb and Spice Beer. All beers with chili peppers should be entered as Chili Pepper Beer. Beers made with pumpkin in which herb and spice characters dominate and which nonetheless lack perceivable pumpkin character would be appropriately characterized as Herb and Spice beer. _A statement by the brewer explaining herbs or spices used and underlying beer style is essential for accurate assessment in competitions._
