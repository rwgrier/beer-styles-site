<h1>Chili Pepper Beer</h1>

<p>Chili Pepper Beers are any range of color from pale to very dark depending on the underlying style. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Chili Beers are any beers using chili peppers as a flavor, aroma or “heat” inducing adjunct to create distinct and balanced (ranging from subtle to intense) character. Chili pepper aromas ranging from subtle to intense may or may not be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Malt sweetness can vary from very low to medium-high levels, depending on the underlying beer style. Hop bitterness is very low to medium-high. Chili pepper aroma and flavor qualities should not be overpowered by hop aroma and flavor, and should be present in harmony with characteristics typical of the underlying beer style. Chili pepper qualities may vary widely as vegetal, spicy or "heat" inducing flavors and/or aromas. At competition, all beers containing chili peppers should be entered as Chili Beer. Beers which represent more than one style (for example chili beers with chocolate) would also be appropriately entered as Chili Beer. <em>A statement by the brewer explaining chili peppers used and information about the underlying classic or other beer style is essential in order for accurate assessment in competitions.</em></p>
