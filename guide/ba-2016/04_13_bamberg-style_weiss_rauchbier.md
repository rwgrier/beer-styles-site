Hop aroma is not perceived. In darker versions a detectable degree of roast malt may be present without being robust. Smoky malt flavor ranging from low to high is present. Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is low. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat. No diacetyl should be perceived. The flavor of a Weissbier is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- like or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present.
