<h1>Scottish-Style Export Ale</h1>

<p>Scottish-Style Export Ales are medium amber to dark chestnut brown. Chill haze is allowable at low temperatures. Malty, caramel-like aroma dominates. Fruity- ester aromas may be apparent. Hop aroma is not perceived. The overriding character of Scottish Export is sweet, caramel-like, and malty. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is low to medium. Fruity-ester character may be apparent. Yeast characters such as diacetyl and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. Bottled versions may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Body is medium. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish Export Ale exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many examples with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels. Ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category. <em>Scottish Export Ale may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).</em></p>
