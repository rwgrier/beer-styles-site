<h1>Classic French &amp; Belgian-Style Saison</h1>

<p>Classic French &amp; Belgian-Style Saisons are gold to light amber. Chill or slight yeast haze is acceptable. Malt aroma is low. Fruity-ester aromas are medium to high. Earthy, cellar-like and/or musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl aroma should not be perceived. Hop aroma is low to medium and characterized by European-type hops: floral, herbal and/or woody traits are common. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop flavor is low to medium and characterized by European-type hops: floral, herbal and/or woody traits are common. Hop bitterness is medium-low to medium and not assertive. Very low levels of <em>Brettanomyces</em> character that are slightly acidic, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like may or may not be evident in the overall balanced beer. Fruitiness and spicy black pepper from classic Belgian-type yeast fermentation may be in character. Diacetyl flavor should not be perceived. These beers are well attenuated, and often bottle conditioned contributing some yeast character and high carbonation. Body is generally very low to low.</p>
