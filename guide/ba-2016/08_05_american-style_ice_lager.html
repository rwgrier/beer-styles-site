<h1>American-Style Ice Lager</h1>

<p>American-Style Ice Lagers are very pale to golden. Chill haze is absent. Fruity-ester and diacetyl aromas should not be perceived. Hop aroma is low. Low residual malt sweetness is present. Hop flavor is low. Hop bitterness is low but certainly perceptible. This style is slightly higher in alcohol than most other light-colored American-Style lagers. It has few or no adjuncts. Typically these beers are chilled before filtration so that ice crystals (which may or may not be removed) are formed. This process can contribute to a higher alcohol content (up to 0.5% more). Fruity-ester and diacetyl flavors should not be perceived. Body is low to medium.</p>
