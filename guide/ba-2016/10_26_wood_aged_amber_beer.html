<h1>Wood- and Barrel-Aged Pale to Amber Beer</h1>

<p>Wood- and Barrel-Aged Pale to Amber Beers are pale to copper. For purposes of competition these wood-aged beers have color less than 18 SRM or 36 EBC, and contain alcohol less than 5.2% abw or 6.5% abv. Darker wood- aged beers (&gt;18 SRM or &gt;36 EBC) or higher alcohol wood-aged beers (&gt;5% abw or &gt;6.25% abv) of any color would be more appropriately characterized as other beer styles. Any lager, ale or hybrid beer in the appropriate color range, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer, can be aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. Primary character of the original beer style may or may not be apparent. These beers are aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel; but, wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Wood-Aged Pale to Amber Beers may or may not have <em>Brettanomyces</em> character. Body is variable with style. For purposes of competition fruited or spiced pale to amber beer that is wood and barrel aged would also be appropriately entered in this category. Sour wood-aged beers of any color or strength would more appropriately be characterized as Wood-Aged Sour Beer. <em>A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer is essential to accurate assessment at competition. Comments could include: base beer style being aged in wood, type and age of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), previous barrel contents if any (new, port/ whiskey/ wine/ sherry/ other), and achieved character.</em></p>
