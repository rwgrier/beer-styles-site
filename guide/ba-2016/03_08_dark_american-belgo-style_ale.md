# Dark American-Belgo-Style Ale

Dark American-Belgo-Style Ales are brown to black. Chill haze may be evident. Fruity-ester aroma is medium to high. Hop aroma is medium to very high, exhibiting American type hop aromas not usually found in traditional Belgian styles. Perception of roasted malts or barley will be subtle to robust. Hop flavor is medium to very high. Hop bitterness is medium to very high. Fruity-ester flavor should be medium to high. Yeast derived characters such as banana, berry, apple, sometimes coriander spice-like and/or smoky-phenolic characters should be portrayed with balance of hops and malt character when fermented with Belgian yeasts. Diacetyl should be absent. Sulfur-like yeast character should be absent. Brettanomyces character should be absent. Dark American-Belgo-Style Ales are either 1) non-Belgian darker beer types portraying the unique characters imparted by yeasts typically used in big fruity Belgian-style ales, or 2) defined darker Belgian-style beers portraying a unique character of American hops. These beers are unique beers unto themselves. _To allow for accurate judging the brewer must provide information that identifies the classic beer style being elaborated upon (if there is one) or other information unique to the entry with regard to flavor, aroma and/or appearance. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging._
