<h1>Fresh or Wet Hop Beer</h1>

<p>Fresh or Wet Hop Beers are the color of the underlying ale style being made with fresh hops. Fruity-ester aroma is high, although somewhat dependent on the ale style being made with fresh hops. Hop aroma is prominent and will exhibit especially aromas of green, almost chlorophyll-like or other fresh hop characters. Malt perception will vary with the style of ale being made with fresh hops. Hop flavor is prominent, exhibiting especially flavors of green, almost chlorophyll-like or other fresh hop characters. Hop bitterness is dependent on the style of ale being made with fresh hops. These ales are hopped predominantly with fresh (newly harvested and kilned) and/or undried ("wet") hops. Beers may be aged and enjoyed after initial "fresh-hop" character diminishes. Unique character(s) may emerge from the aging of fresh hop beers, but these have yet to be defined. Body is dependent on the style of ale being made with fresh hops. <em>A statement provided by the brewer identifying a classic or other beer style, variety and condition of hops and manner in which the hops are used is essential for accurate assessment at competitions.</em></p>
