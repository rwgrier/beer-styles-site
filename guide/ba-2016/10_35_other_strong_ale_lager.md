# Other Strong Ale or Lager

Other Strong Ale or Lagers are any color from very light to black. <u>Any</u> style of beer can be made stronger than the classic style guidelines. The goal should be to reach a balance between the style's character and the additional alcohol. Whenever possible, refer to accompanying guidelines when making styles stronger and appropriately identify the style created. Body is variable with style. _A statement provided by the brewer which identifies the underlying style of ale or lager being made stronger and/or a reference to level of strength of the resulting beer is essential to accurate assessment at competition._
