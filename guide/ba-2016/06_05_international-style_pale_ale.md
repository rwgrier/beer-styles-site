# International-Style Pale Ale

International-Style Pale Ales are gold to light brown.
Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Recognizing the wide range of distinctive hop flavors and aromas which characterize Pale Ales from around the world, International Pale Ales will be assessed on the merits that they do not fit existing Pale Ale guidelines (such as American, English or Australian). Low caramel malt aroma may be present. Hop aroma is absent to high and reflective of hop flavor. Very low to medium maltiness is present. Low caramel malt flavor may be present. Hop flavor is very low to high, and may reflect a wide range of characters evident in hop varieties from origins not otherwise outlined in these guidelines, for example, tropical fruity qualities typical of New Zealand hop varieties and/or spicy, woody or other qualities typical of German hop varieties, or other origins. Hop bitterness is medium to high. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be low to high. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. DMS should not be present. Body is low to medium.
