<p>Traditional Dark Schöps are dark brown to black. They are made with a high proportion (as much as 80%) of dark wheat malt as well as other specialty toasted and dark specialty malts, and has high malt character with aromas of toasted or nut-like malt, but not caramel. Fruity-ester aromas may be evident since this is a beer fermented with ale yeast, but not with traditional wheat beer yeast. Diacetyl and phenolic aromas should not be perceived. Hop aroma is very low. Dark Schöps has medium to medium- high malt sweetness. Roast malt bitterness may be evident at low levels. Hop bitterness is low. Fruity-ester flavors may be present. Diacetyl and phenolic flavors should be absent. Body is full.</p>
