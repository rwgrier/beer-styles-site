<h1>South German-Style Dunkel Weizen</h1>

<p>South German-Style Dunkel Weizens are copper-brown to very dark. If served with yeast appearance may appropriately be very cloudy. The phenolic and estery aromas typical of Weissbiers are more subdued in Dunkel Weissbier. No diacetyl aroma should be perceived. Hop aroma is not perceived. Distinct sweet maltiness and a chocolate-like character from roasted malt characterize this beer style. Usually dark barley malts are used in conjunction with dark cara or color malts. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is low. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat. The phenolic and estery flavors of Dunkel Weissbier should be evident but subdued. Dunkel Weissbier should be well attenuated and very highly carbonated. No diacetyl should be perceived. Body is medium to full. These beers are typically roused during pouring and because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel. <em>During competition, entries will be roused unless instructed otherwise by the entering brewer.</em></p>
