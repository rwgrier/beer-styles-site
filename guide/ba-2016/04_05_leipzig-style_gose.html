<h1>Leipzig-Style Gose</h1>

<p>Leipzig-Style Goses are straw to medium amber. Appearance is cloudy/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Lemony or other citrus-like aromas are often present. Some versions may have the spicy aroma character of added coriander at low to medium levels. Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by <em>Brettanomyces</em> yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low. They typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, and may contain oats. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not perceived. Lemony or other citrus-like flavors are often present. Some versions may have the spicy flavor character of added coriander on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Body is low to medium-low. Traditional examples of Gose are spontaneously fermented. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. <em>At competitions, brewers might provide supplemental information such as whether coriander, salt and/or Brettanomyces is used and/or other information about the brewing process.</em></p>
