# Berliner-Style Weisse

Berliner Weissbiers are straw to pale, the lightest of all the German wheat beers. Appearance may be hazy or cloudy from yeast or chill haze. Fruity-ester aroma will be evident at low to medium levels. No diacetyl should be perceived. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is absent. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not existent to very low. The unique combination of yeast and lactic acid bacteria fermentation yields a beer that is acidic and highly attenuated. Fruity-ester flavors will be evident at low to medium levels. No _Brettanomyces_ character or diacetyl should be perceived. Berliners are sometimes served with sweet fruit or herbal syrups. Body is very low. Carbonation is high. _At competition, subcategories for unfruited and fruited or flavored versions of the style could be created. For unfruited versions, brewer would indicate that no fruit or flavor has been added. Fruited or flavored entries would be accompanied by a very brief description of the fruit/flavor used by the brewer._
