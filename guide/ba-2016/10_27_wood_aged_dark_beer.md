# Wood- and Barrel-Aged Dark Beer

Wood- and Barrel-Aged Dark Beers are brown to black. For purposes of competition these wood-aged beers have color greater than 18 SRM or 36 EBC, and contain alcohol less than 5.2% abw or 6.5% abv. Paler wood-aged beers (<18 SRM or <36 EBC) or higher alcohol wood-aged beers (>5% abw or >6.25% abv) of any color would be more appropriately characterized as other beer styles. Any lager, ale or hybrid beer in the appropriate color range, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer, can be aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. Primary character of the original beer style may or may not be apparent. These beers are aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel; but, wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Wood-Aged Dark Beers may or may not have _Brettanomyces_ character. Body is variable with style. For purposes of competition fruited or spiced dark beer that is wood and barrel aged would also be appropriately entered in this category. Sour wood-aged beers of any color or strength would more appropriately be characterized as Wood-Aged Sour Beer. _A statement provided by the brewer identifying a classic or other beer style, type and condition of wood, previous liquid in the barrel, and any other ingredients used is essential for accurate assessment at competitions._
