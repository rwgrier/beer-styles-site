<h1>Belgian-Style Table Beer</h1>

<p>Belgian-Style Table Beers are gold to black, with caramel color sometimes added to adjust color. Spices (such as orange and lemon peel, as well as coriander) may be added for barely perceptible aroma, but this is not common. Diacetyl aroma should not be perceived. Hop aroma not perceived to very low. Mild malt character could be evident. These beers may contain malted barley, wheat and rye, as well as unmalted wheat, rye, oats and corn. Hop flavor is very low to low. Hop bitterness is very low to low. Spices (such as orange and lemon peel, as well as coriander) may be added in amounts barely perceptible for flavor, but this is not common. Diacetyl flavor should not be perceived. Traditional versions do not use artificial sweeteners nor are they excessively sweet. More modern versions of this beer can incorporate sweeteners such as sugar and saccharine added post fermentation to sweeten the palate and add to perception of smoothness. Body is low with relatively low carbonation and aftertaste. The mouth feel is light to moderate, though higher than one might anticipate, usually because of unfermented sugars/malt sugars. <em>Competition directors may choose to break out subcategories of Traditional and Modern.</em></p>
