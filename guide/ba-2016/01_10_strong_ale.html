<h1>Strong Ale</h1>

<p>Strong Ales are amber to dark brown. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Rich, often complex fruity esters can contribute to the aroma profile. Hop aroma is not perceived to very low. They have malty and/or caramel- like sweetness. They may have very low levels of roast malt. Hop flavor is not perceived to medium. Hop bitterness is minimal but evident, and balanced with the malt flavors present. Fruity-ester flavors can contribute to the character of this ale as a rich, often sweet and complex estery character. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. Very low levels of diacetyl are acceptable. Body is medium to full. <em>This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong.</em></p>
