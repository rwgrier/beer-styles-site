# Smoke Beer

Smoke Beers are any beer of any style incorporating smoke, and therefore may range from very light to black. Any style of beer can be smoked; the goal is to reach a balance between the style's character and the smoky properties. Body is variable with style. Any smoke beer that does not fit other smoke beer categories would be appropriately considered here. _A statement provided by the brewer which identifies the type of wood or other source of smoke and the classic or other style of beer is essential to accurate assessment at competition._
