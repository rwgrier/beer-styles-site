Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is low. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat. The phenolic and estery flavors of Dunkel Weissbier should be evident but subdued. Dunkel Weissbier should be well attenuated and very highly carbonated. No diacetyl should be perceived. Body is medium to full.
