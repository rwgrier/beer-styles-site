<h1>German-Style Doppelbock</h1>

<p>German-Style Doppelbocks are copper to dark brown. Dominant malt aromas are reminiscent of fresh and lightly toasted Munich-style malt, more so than caramel or toffee malt character. Some elements of caramel and toffee can be evident in aroma and contribute to complexity, but the predominant malt aroma is an expression of toasted barley malt. Hop aroma is absent. Malty sweetness is dominant but should not be cloying. Malt flavor character is primarily fresh and lightly toasted Munich-style malt, more so than caramel or toffee malt character. Some elements of caramel and toffee flavor can be evident, but predominant malt character is toasted barley malt. Astringency from roast malts is absent. Hop flavor is perceived as low. Hop bitterness is perceived as low. Alcoholic strength is high. Fruity-ester flavors are commonly perceived but at low to moderate levels. Diacetyl should be absent. Body is full.</p>
