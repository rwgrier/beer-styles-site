# Specialty Honey Beer

Specialty Honey Beers are very light to black depending on underlying style. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Honey Beers use honey in addition to malted barley. Character of honey should be evident in aroma, flavor and/or overall balance with the other components, without overpowering them. Malt sweetness will vary dramatically depending on overall balance desired. Hop bitterness is very low to very high, and may be used for highlighting desired characters. Honey Beers may be brewed to a traditional style, or may be experimental. Body is variable with style. _A statement by the brewer explaining the classic or other style of the beer, and the type of honey used is essential in order for accurate assessment in competitions._
