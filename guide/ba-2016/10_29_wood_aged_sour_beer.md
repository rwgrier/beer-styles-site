# Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer

Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beers are very light to black. Fruit and herb/spice versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients. Any lager, ale or hybrid beers, either in a traditional style or unique experimental beers, can be aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood, and, develop bacterial induced natural acidity. These beers are aged with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel; but, wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of wood- derived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Usually bacteria and “wild” yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in dry to very dry beers. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Wood-Aged Sour Beers may or may not have _Brettanomyces_ character. Body is variable with style. _A statement provided by the brewer identifying a classic or other beer style, type and condition of wood, previous liquid in the barrel, cultures and any other ingredients used is essential for accurate assessment at competitions._
