<h1>Dark American Wheat Beer without Yeast</h1>

<p>Dark American Wheat Beers without Yeast are medium amber to dark brown. Chill haze is acceptable in these versions packaged and served without yeast. Malt aromas can include low roasted malt characters evident as cocoa/chocolate or caramel, and/or aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters. Low fruity-ester aroma is typical, as is low to medium-low malt aroma. Phenolic, clove-like aromas should not be perceived. Diacetyl aroma should not be perceived. No yeast aroma should be evident. Hop aroma is low to medium. Medium-low to medium- high malt sweetness is present. Malt flavors can include low roasted malt characters evident as cocoa/chocolate or caramel, and/or aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit- like characters. Roast malt astringency acceptable when balanced with malt sweetness. Hop flavor is low to medium. Hop bitterness is low to medium. These beers can be made using either ale or lager yeast. Grist includes at least 30 percent malted wheat. No yeast flavor should be evident. Low fruity-ester flavors are typical. Diacetyl and phenolic, clove-like flavors should not be perceived. Body is low to medium. Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel.</p>
