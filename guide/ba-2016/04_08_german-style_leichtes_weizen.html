<h1>German-Style Leichtes Weizen</h1>

<p>German-Style Leichtes Weizens are straw to copper- amber. If served with yeast appearance may appropriately be very cloudy. The phenolic and estery aromas typical of Weissbiers are more subdued in Leichtes Weizen. No diacetyl aroma should be perceived. Hop aroma is not perceived to very low. Malt sweetness is very low to medium-low. Hop flavor is not perceived to very low. Hop bitterness is very low. These beers are made with at least 50 percent wheat malt. The phenolic and estery flavors typical of Weissbiers are more subdued in Leichtes Weizen. The overall flavor profile is less complex than Hefeweizen due to decreased alcohol content and there is less yeasty flavor present. No diacetyl should be perceived. Body is low with diminished mouth feel relative to hefeweizen. The German word leicht means light, and as such these beers are light versions of Hefeweizen. These beers are often roused during pouring, and when yeast is present the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel. <em>During competition, entries will be roused unless instructed otherwise by the entering brewer.</em></p>
