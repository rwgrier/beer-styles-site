<h1>Wood- and Barrel-Aged Strong Beer</h1>

<p>Wood- and Barrel-Aged Strong Beers are any color. For purposes of competition these wood-aged beers contain alcohol greater than 5.2% abw or 6.5% abv. Any strong classic or unique experimental lager, ale or hybrid beer style, either a traditional style or unique experimental beers, can be aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. These beers are aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel; but, wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Wood-Aged Beers may or may not have <em>Brettanomyces</em> character. Body is variable with style. For purposes of competition fruited or spiced strong beer that is wood and barrel aged would also be appropriately entered in this category. Sour wood- aged strong beers would more appropriately be characterized as Wood-Aged Sour Beer. <em>A statement provided by the brewer identifying a classic or other beer style, type and condition of wood, previous liquid in the barrel, and any other ingredients used is essential for accurate assessment at competitions.</em></p>
