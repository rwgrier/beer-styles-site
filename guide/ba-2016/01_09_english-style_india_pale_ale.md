English-Style India Pale Ales are gold to copper colored. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Fruity-ester aromas are moderate to very strong. Hop aroma is medium to high, often flowery. Medium malt flavor is present. Hop flavor is medium to strong (in addition to the hop bitterness). Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. Hop bitterness is medium to high. Fruity-ester flavors are moderate to very strong. Most traditional interpretations are characterized by medium to medium- high alcohol content. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Body is medium. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.
