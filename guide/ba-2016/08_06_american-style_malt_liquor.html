<h1>American-Style Malt Liquor</h1>

<p>American-Style Malt Liquors are straw to gold. Chill haze is absent. Fruity-ester and complex alcohol aromas (though not solvent-like) are acceptable at low levels. Diacetyl aroma should not be perceived. Hop aroma is not perceived. Some residual sweetness is perceived. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is very low. High in starting gravity and alcoholic strength, this style is somewhat diverse. Some malt liquors are just slightly stronger than American lagers, while others approach bock strength. Fruity-ester and complex alcohol (though not solvent-like) flavors are acceptable at low levels. Diacetyl flavor should not be perceived. Body is low to medium- low.</p>
