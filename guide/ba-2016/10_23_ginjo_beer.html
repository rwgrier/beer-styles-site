<h1>Ginjo Beer or Sake-Yeast Beer</h1>

<p>Ginjo Beer or Sake-Yeast Beers are pale to dark brown. Slight chill haze is permissible. These beers are brewed with sake yeast or sake (koji) enzymes. The unique aromas of the byproducts of sake yeast and/or koji enzymes should be distinctive and harmonize with the other malt and hop aromas. Sake character may best be described as having mild fruitiness and a gentle and mild earthiness, mushroom and/or umami protein-like character. Malt aroma is very low to medium. Hop aroma is low to medium and should harmonize with sake-like characters. Malt sweetness is very low to medium. Hop flavor is low to medium and should harmonize with sake-like characters. Hop bitterness is low to medium and should harmonize with sake-like characters. A high amount of alcohol may be evident. The unique flavors should reflect perceived or possible unique aromas described above and harmonize with other malt and hop characters. Body is dependent on base style and original gravity, as is mouthfeel. High carbonation should be evident.</p>
