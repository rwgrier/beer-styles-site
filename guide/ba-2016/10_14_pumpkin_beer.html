<h1>Pumpkin/Squash Beer</h1>

<p>Pumpkin/Squash Beers are any range of color from pale to very dark depending on the underlying style. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Pumpkin or squash aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident. These beers are any beers using pumpkins (<em>Cucurbito pepo</em>) or winter squash as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, qualities. They are not flavored with the addition of spices but may have flavors associated with a particular style of beer (examples: smoked beer, fruit beer, sour beer). Spice aromas and flavors should be absent; versions exhibiting spice aromas and/or flavors would most appropriately be characterized as pumpkin spice beer or other categories. Hop aroma is none to medium. Malt sweetness often varies from low to medium high levels depending on the underlying beer style. Hop flavor is none to medium. Hop bitterness is low to medium-low. Beers made with pumpkin or squash, but which do not exhibit pumpkin or squash aromas or flavors, would be more appropriately characterized within the underlying classic or experimental beer style. Body is variable with style. <em>A statement by the brewer explaining the nature of the beer is essential for accurate assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with pumpkin, the brewer should also specify the classic style.</em></p>
