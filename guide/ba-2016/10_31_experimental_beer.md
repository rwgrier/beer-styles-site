# Experimental Beer

Experimental Beers are any range of color. Experimental beer is any beer that is primarily grain-based and employs unique and unusual techniques and/or ingredients or a combination of ingredients and techniques. A minimum 51% of the fermentable carbohydrates must be derived from malted grains. The overall uniqueness of the process, ingredients used and creativity should be considered in positive evaluations. Body is variable with style. Uniqueness is the primary consideration when evaluating this category. Beers such as field, fruit, chocolate, coffee, spice, specialty or other beers that match existing categories should not be entered into this category. Beers not easily matched to existing style categories in a competition would often be entered into this category. By definition and for purposes of competition, beers that represent a combination of two or more other categories, and which exhibit distinctive characters of each of those categories, may appropriately be characterized as Experimental Beer. _A statement provided by the brewer explaining the unique and experimental or other nature of the beer is essential in order for accurate assessment in competitions. Generally, a 25-word statement would suffice in explaining the experimental nature of the beer._
