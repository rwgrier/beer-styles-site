<h1>Smoke Porter</h1>

<p>Smoke Porters are dark brown to black. Fruity-ester aroma is acceptable. They will exhibit a mild to assertive smoke malt aroma in balance with other aroma characters. Hop aroma is not perceived to medium. They will exhibit a mild to assertive smoke malt flavor in balance with other flavors. Black malt character can be perceived in some porters, while others may be absent of strong roast character. Roast barley character should be absent. Medium to high malt sweetness, caramel and chocolate are acceptable. Hop flavor is not perceived to medium. Hop bitterness is medium to medium-high. Fruity-ester flavor is acceptable. Body is medium to full. <em>To allow for accurate judging the brewer must list the traditional style of porter as well as the wood type used as a smoke source (e.g. "alder smoked brown porter"). Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging.</em></p>
