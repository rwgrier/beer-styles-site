<h1>Dark American Wheat Beer with Yeast</h1>

<p>Dark American Wheat Beers with Yeast are medium amber to dark brown. Because this style is served with yeast in the bottle, appearance may range from hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Malt aromas can include low roasted malt characters evident as cocoa/chocolate or caramel, and/or aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters. Low fruity-ester aroma is typical, as is low to medium-low malt aroma. Yeast aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. Phenolic, clove- like aromas should not be perceived. Diacetyl aroma should not be perceived. Hop aroma is low to medium. Medium-low to medium-high malt sweetness is present. Malt flavors can include low roasted malt characters evident as cocoa/chocolate or caramel, and/or aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters. Roast malt astringency is acceptable when balanced with malt sweetness. Hop flavor is low to medium. Hop bitterness is low to medium. These beers can be made using either ale or lager yeast. Grist includes at least 30 percent malted wheat. Low to medium yeast flavor should not overpower the balance and character of malt and hops. Low fruity- ester flavors are typical. Diacetyl and phenolic, clove-like flavors should not be perceived. Body is low to medium. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel.</p>
