# Specialty Saison

Specialty Saisons are pale to dark brown. Chill or slight yeast haze is acceptable. There may be quite a variety of characters in these beers which differ from classic Saisons. Malt aroma is low to medium-low. Fruity-ester aromas are medium to high. Earthy, cellar-like and/or musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl aroma should not be perceived. Hop aroma is low to medium. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop flavor is low to medium. Hop bitterness is medium to medium-high. Contemporary "Specialty" Saison beers include a very wide family of specialty beers. Specialty ingredients (spices, herbs, flowers, fruits, vegetables, fermentable sugars and carbohydrates, special yeasts of all types, wood aging, etc.) may contribute unique and signature character. Complex alcohols, herbs, spices, low _Brettanomyces_ character including slightly acidic, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like, and even clove and smoke-like phenolics may or may not be evident in the overall balanced beer. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A low level of sour acidic flavor is acceptable when in balance with other components. Diacetyl flavor should not be perceived. These beers are often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. Color, body, malt character, esters, alcohol level and hop character should be in harmony with the general style description. Body is generally low to medium. _At competition, specialty- ingredient-flavored Saisons can be their own categories or subcategories of the main style._
