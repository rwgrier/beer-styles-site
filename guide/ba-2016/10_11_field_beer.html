<h1>Field Beer</h1>

<p>Field Beers are any range of color from pale to very dark depending on the underlying style, and may take on the color of added ingredients. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Vegetable aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Field Beers are any beers using vegetables as flavor or carbohydrate adjuncts in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, qualities. Malt sweetness can vary from very low to medium-high levels. Hop bitterness is very low to medium- high. Vegetable qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. Body is variable with style. Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of vegetable characters more so than the addition of vegetable itself. All beers containing chili peppers should be entered as Chili Beer. At competition, coconut is defined as a vegetable, and beers containing coconut would be appropriately entered as Field Beer. <em>A statement by the brewer explaining vegetables used and information about the underlying classic or other beer style is essential in order for accurate assessment in competitions.</em></p>
