Export-Style Stouts are black. Head retention is excellent. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas are prominent. Fruity-ester aroma is low. Hop aroma is not perceived. Initial malt and light caramel flavor profile give way to a distinctive dry-roasted bitterness in the finish. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is often analytically high, but the perception is often compromised by malt sweetness. Perception of fruity-ester flavor is low. Diacetyl should be negligible or not perceived. Slight acidity is acceptable. Body is medium to full.
