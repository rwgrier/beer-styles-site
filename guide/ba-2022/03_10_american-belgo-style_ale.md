# American-Belgo-Style Ale

- **Color:** Gold to black
- **Clarity:** Should conform the base beer style
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Typically low. Perception of specialty or roasted malts or barley can be very low to robust in darker versions.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Medium to very high, exhibiting American-type hop aromas not usually found in traditional Belgian styles.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium to high, in alignment with base beer style.
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity esters are medium to high. Belgian yeast attributes such as banana, berry, apple, coriander, spice or smoky- phenolic should be in balance with malt and hops. Diacetyl, sulfur, and attributes typical of _Brettanomyces_ should not be present.
- **Body:** Medium-low to medium, in alignment with base beer style.
- **Additional notes:** American-Belgo-Style Ales are either 1) non-Belgian beer types portraying the unique characters imparted by yeasts typically used in big, fruity Belgian-style ales, or 2) defined Belgian- style beers displaying the hallmark attributes typical of American variety hops. These beers are unique unto themselves. <br/>
