# South German-Style Weizenbock

- **Color:** Gold to very dark
- **Clarity:** If served with yeast, appearance may be very cloudy.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Medium malty sweetness should be present. If dark, a mild roast malt character should emerge in the flavor and, to a lesser degree, in the aroma.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not present
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Balanced, clove-like phenolic and fruity ester banana notes produce a well-rounded flavor and aroma. Diacetyl should not be present. Carbonation should be high.
- **Body:** Medium to full
- **Additional notes:** Beers in this style are made with at least 50 percent wheat malt. They are often roused during pouring, and, when yeast is present, will have a yeasty flavor and a fuller mouthfeel.
