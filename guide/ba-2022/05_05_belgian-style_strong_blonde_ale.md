- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Medium-low to medium-high
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium-low to medium-high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Low to medium fruity esters are present. Yeast-derived phenolic spicy flavors and aromas should be present at low to medium-low levels. Diacetyl is usually absent in these beers but may be present at very low levels.
- **Body:** Very low to medium
- **Additional notes:** These beers are often brewed with light-colored Belgian candy sugar. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales.

Some versions may be equally high in alcohol with a more medium in body.
