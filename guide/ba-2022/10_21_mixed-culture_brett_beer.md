# Mixed-Culture Brett Beer

- **Color:** Any color is acceptable. Beer color may be influenced by the color of added fruits or other ingredients.
- **Clarity:** Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze is allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** In darker versions, any of roasted malt, caramel, or chocolate aroma and flavor attributes are present at low levels.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Low to high
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low to high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Medium to high fruity esters are present. Acidity resulting from fermentation with _Brettanomyces_ and bacteria results in a complex flavor profile. _Brettanomyces_ character should be present and expressed as any of horsey, goaty, leathery, phenolic, fruity, or acidic aroma and flavor attributes. Cultured yeast may be used in the fermentation. Bacteria should be incorporated and in evidence. Bacteria will contribute acidity which may or may not dominate the flavor profile. Diacetyl and DMS should not be present.
- **Body:** Low to high
- **Additional notes:** Fruited versions will exhibit fruit flavors in balance with other elements. Wood vessels may be used for fermentation and aging; such beers may or may not exhibit attributes typical of wood- aging such as vanillin or of liquids previously aged in a barrel (bourbon, sherry, etc.). <br/>
