# Export-Style Stout

- **Color:** Black

- **Perceived bitterness:** May be analytically high, but the perception is lessened by malt sweetness.
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity esters are low. Diacetyl is usually absent in these beers but may be present at very low levels. Slight acidity is acceptable.

- **Additional notes:** Head retention should be persistent
