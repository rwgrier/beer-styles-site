<h1>Belgian-Style Quadrupel</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Amber to dark brown</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Caramel, dark sugar and malty sweet flavors and aromas can be intense, but not cloying, and should complement fruitiness.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Not present to very low</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Low to medium-low</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Perception of alcohol can be strong. Complex fruity attributes reminiscent of any of raisins, dates, figs, grapes, or plums are often present and may be accompanied by wine-like attributes at low levels. Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma may be present at low to medium-low levels. Diacetyl and DMS should not be present.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Full with creamy mouthfeel</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Head should be dense and mousse-like. Quadrupels are well attenuated and are characterized by an intense alcohol presence balanced by other flavors, aromas and bitterness. They are well balanced with savoring/sipping-type drinkability. Oxidized character, if present in aged Quads, should be mild and pleasant.</li>
</ul>
