<h1>Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Varies with underlying style and can be influenced by the color of added fruit(s) if any</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Varies with underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Varies with underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Varies with underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Varies with underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Typical of underlying style of beer being aged</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Varies with underlying style</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> These are any traditional or experimental style of lager, ale or hybrid beer aged in either a wooden barrel or in contact with wood chips, spirals, strips or many other formats. These beers are aged with the intention of developing unique attributes imparted by the wood, or liquids that had previously been stored in contact with the wood. Wood-aging does not necessarily impart wood flavors, but does result in distinctive sensory outcomes. Used sherry, rum, whiskey, tequila, port, wine, and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to a beer. A balance of flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel results from the marriage of new beer with attributes imparted by the wood or barrel. Categorizing these beers can be complex. Sour versions which do not exhibit attributes typical of <em>Brettanomyces</em> are categorized as Wood-Aged Sour Beer. Wood-Aged Beers which exhibit sensory attributes typical of <em>Brettanomyces</em> alone, or of <em>Brettanomyces</em> and other microbes, are categorized as Brett Beer or Mixed-Culture Brett Beer respectively. Wood-aged versions of various classic India Pale Ales are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale. Belgian-style ales that exhibit attributes of wood-aging are categorized as Other Belgian Ale or within other Belgian categories. Various fruited Belgian-style beers that exhibit attributes of wood-aging are categorized as Belgian- Style Fruit Beer; similarly, Saison aged in wood and which exhibits attributes of wood-aging is categorized as Specialty Saison.<br/>
<em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as length of time aged, type of wood or barrel, age, char level or previous liquids held by the wood, ingredients or other processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes. Competition organizers may create subcategories which reflect groups of entries based on color, alcoholic strength, underlying beer style, fruit, etc.</em></li>
