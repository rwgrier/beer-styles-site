# South German-Style Bernsteinfarbenes Weizen

- **Color:** Amber to light brown. The German word ‘Bernsteinfarben’ means amber colored.
- **Clarity:** If served with yeast, appearance may be very cloudy.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Distinct sweet maltiness and caramel or bread-like character arises from the use of medium-colored malts.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not present
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** The phenolic and estery aromas and flavors typical of Weissbiers are present but less pronounced in Bernsteinfarbenes Weissbiers. These beers should be well attenuated and very highly carbonated. Diacetyl should not be present.
- **Body:** Medium to full
- **Additional notes:** Beers in this style are made with at least 50 percent wheat malt. They are often roused during pouring, and, when yeast is present, will have a yeasty flavor and a fuller mouthfeel.
