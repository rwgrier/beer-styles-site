# Juicy or Hazy Imperial or Double India Pale Ale

- **Color:** Straw to light amber
- **Clarity:** Can vary widely from very low haze to very high degree of cloudiness. Starch, yeast, hop, protein or other compounds contribute to a wide range of hazy appearance within this category.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Low to high malt aroma and flavor may be present
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** High to intense, exhibiting a very wide range of attributes, especially fruity, tropical, juicy, and many others.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low to medium. The impression of bitterness is soft and well-integrated into overall balance, and may differ significantly from measured or calculated IBU levels.
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Medium-high to high fruity esters are present, and can contribute to the perception of sweetness and be complementary to the hop profile. Diacetyl should not be present.
- **Body:** Medium to high. A silky or full mouthfeel may contribute to overall flavor profile.
- **Additional notes:** Grist may include oats, wheat, or other adjuncts to promote haziness. The term ‘juicy’ is frequently used to describe taste and aroma hop- derived attributes often present in these beers which result from late, often very large, additions of hops. A juicy character is not required, however. Likewise the term ‘hazy’ is frequently used to describe the appearance of many examples of these beers. However, some versions may exhibit very low cloudiness. Other hop-derived attributes such as citrus, pine, spice, floral or others may be present with or without the presence of juicy attributes. These beers can exhibit astringency and heat (sometimes referred to as ‘hop burn’) as a result of very high hop usage rates and excessive contact time in beer, which can detract from balance and drinkability when present above low levels. Versions of this style brewed with darker malts, non- traditional ale yeasts, fruits, spices, or other flavorings are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale.
