# Oatmeal Stout

- **Color:** Dark brown to black
- **Clarity:** Beer color may be too dark to perceive. When clarity is perceivable, chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Coffee, caramel, roasted malt, or chocolate aromas should be prominent. Roasted malt character of caramel or chocolate should be smooth without bitterness.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Optional, but if present should not upset the overall balance.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Oatmeal is used in the grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor without being grainy. Fruity esters are not present to very low. Diacetyl is usually absent in these beers but may be present at very low levels.
- **Body:** Full with an often-silky mouthfeel
