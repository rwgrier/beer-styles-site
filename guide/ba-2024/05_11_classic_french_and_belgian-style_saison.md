- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium-low to medium, but not assertive.
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity esters are medium to high. Low to medium-low level phenolics may be present, expressed as spice-like or other attributes. Phenolics should not be harsh or dominant and should be in harmony with ester profile and hops. Fruity and spicy black pepper attributes derived from Belgian yeast are common. Diacetyl should not be present. Low levels of _Brettanomyces_ yeast-derived aroma and flavor attributes including any of slightly acidic, fruity, horsey, goaty, or leather-like, may be present but are not required.

Versions which exhibit sensory attributes typical of wood-aging are characterized as Specialty Saison.
