<h1>Contemporary Belgian-Style Spontaneous Fermented Ale</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color:</strong> Gold to very dark</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Cloudiness is acceptable, as these beers are frequently bottle conditioned.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Sweet malt character is not present. Some versions may exhibit attributes typical of specialty malts.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor:</strong> Not present to low and can include cheesy, floral or other attributes typical of aged or unaged hops.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived bitterness:</strong> Very low</li>
<li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> These blended and secondary fermented beers may be very dry or mildly sweet. They are characterized by intense fruity ester, sour, and acidic attributes which only result from spontaneous fermentation. Diacetyl should not be present. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery, and phenolic aromas and flavors derived from <em>Brettanomyces</em> yeast are often present at moderate levels. Aged beer is often blended with young beer to create this special style. Vanillin and other wood- derived flavors may range from absent to present at up to low-medium levels. Carbonation can be none (flat) to high.</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> Very low with dry mouthfeel</li>
<li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Contemporary Belgian-Style Spontaneous Fermented Ales takes its inspiration from the Traditional Gueuze whose origin is the Brussels area of Belgium. But these beers incorporate specialty malts, spice(s), fruit(s), or many other diverse ingredients and processes that influence the hue, aroma and flavor outcomes of the finished beers such that they differ significantly from traditional examples. <br/>
<em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as non-traditional malts, sweeteners, fruit(s), spice(s) or any other ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes.</em></li>
</ul>
