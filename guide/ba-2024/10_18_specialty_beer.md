# Specialty Beer

- **Color:** Very light to black depending on the underlying style
- **Clarity:** Clear to hazy is acceptable
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Varies depending on intention of brewer
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Very low to very high
- **Perceived bitterness:** Very low to very high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** **Within the framework of these guidelines, Specialty Beer refers to beers brewed with atypical sources of fermentable sugar such as grains, tubers, starches, syrups, or other sources which contribute to alcohol content. The hallmark of Specialty Beers are the distinctive sensory attributes arising from these special fermentable ingredients, which should be present in the aroma, flavor, and overall balance of the beer.** <br/>
Examples could include maple syrup, agave, potatoes, wild rice, or any other sources of carbohydrate not commonly used in modern beer styles. **Beers containing wheat are categorized in one of several wheat beer styles. The use of rice or corn would not normally be considered unusual since these adjuncts are commonly used in beer production. However, beers made with rice or corn varieties which imbue highly distinctive flavor attributes might be categorized as Specialty Beers.**
- **Body:** Varies with underlying style
- **Additional notes:** Classifying these beers can be complex. Beers brewed with honey or rye are categorized as Specialty Honey Beer or Rye Beer respectively. Beers made with unusual fermentables, which also contain spices, fruits, or other ingredients, and which therefore represent a combination of two or more hybrid beer styles, are categorized as Experimental Beers. Within the framework of these guidelines, nuts generally impart much more flavor than fermentables, and beers containing nuts are categorized as Field Beer. Likewise, within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is defined as a vegetable and beers containing coconut are categorized as Field Beer. Beers brewed with roots, seeds, flowers etc. which exhibit herbal or spicy characters are categorized as Herb and Spice Beers. While beers brewed with fruits or vegetables may derive fermentable carbohydrate from those sources, they are most appropriately categorized as Fruit Beer or Field Beer respectively. Beers representing various India Pale Ale or Imperial India Pale Ale styles brewed with unusual fermentables, and which may or may not also contain fruit(s), spice(s) or other ingredients, are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale.<br/>
_When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as type or form of unusual carbohydrate source used or other factors which influence perceived sensory outcomes._
