# Traditional Belgian-Style Gueuze

- **Color:** Gold to medium amber
- **Clarity:** Appearance can range from clear to low- medium cloudiness arising from yeast, as Gueuze is traditionally bottle conditioned.
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Sweet malt character is not present
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not present to very low and can include cheesy, floral or other attributes.
- **Perceived bitterness:** Very low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Gueuze represents blends of aged and newly fermenting young Lambics. These unflavored blended and secondary fermented beers may range from very dry or mildly sweet. They are characterized by intense fruity ester, sour, and acidic attributes which only result from spontaneous fermentation. Diacetyl should not be present. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic aromas and flavors derived from _Brettanomyces_ yeast are often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other wood-derived flavors may range from absent to present at up to low-medium levels. Carbonation can range from absent to high.
- **Body:** Typically very low with dry mouthfeel. Highly complex flavor profile can lend an impression of fullness.
- **Additional notes:** Gueuze originating in the Brussels area of Belgium are often simply called Gueuze. Versions of this beer style made outside of the Brussels area are said to be ‘Belgian-Style Gueuze’. The Belgian-style versions are made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional Gueuze is dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, or other sweeteners. Traditionally, Gueuze is brewed with unmalted wheat, malted barley, and stale, aged hops.
