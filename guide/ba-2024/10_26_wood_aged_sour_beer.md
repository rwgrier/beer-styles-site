- **Color:** Varies with underlying style
- **Clarity:** Varies with underlying style
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Varies with underlying style
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Varies with underlying style

- **Body:** Varies with underlying style
- **Additional notes:** These are any traditional or experimental style of lager, ale or hybrid beer aged in either a wooden barrel or in contact with wood, and exhibiting acidity derived from exposure to bacteria. These beers are aged in the presence of microflora (either present in the wood or introduced at some time in the brewing process) with the intention of introducing sourness to the beer. These beers are aged with the intention of developing unique attributes imparted by the wood, or by liquids that had previously been stored in contact with the wood. Wood-aging does not necessarily impart wood flavors but does result in distinctive sensory outcomes. Used sherry, rum, whiskey, tequila, port, wine, and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to a beer. A balance of aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel results from the marriage of new beer with attributes imparted by the wood or barrel, and with sourness or other attributes derived from bacteria. Wood-Aged Sour Beer fermented with _Brettanomyces_ or which exhibit sensory attributes typical of _Brettanomyces_ is categorized elsewhere. Such beers made with combinations of fruit(s), herb(s) or spices, or other ingredients, and which therefore represent combinations of multiple hybrid beer styles, are categorized as Experimental Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer.<br/>
_Versions made with fruit(s) will exhibit attributes of wood-aging, acidity, and those added fruit(s). Competition organizers may choose to create subcategories for Wood-aged sour beers made with fruit or other ingredients. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as length of time aged, type of wood or barrel, age, char level or previous liquids held by the wood, micro flora present if known, other ingredients or other processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes._
