# South German-Style Dunkel Weizen

- **Color:** Copper-brown to very dark
- **Clarity:** If served with yeast, appearance may be very cloudy
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Distinct sweet maltiness and a chocolate-like character from dark or roasted malts exemplify beers in this style. Dark barley malts are frequently used along with dark Cara or color malts.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not present
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** The phenolic and estery aromas and flavors typical of Weissbiers are present but less pronounced in Dunkel Weissbiers. Dunkel Weissbiers should be well attenuated and very highly carbonated. Diacetyl should not be present
- **Body:** Medium to full
- **Additional notes:** Beers in this style are made with at least 50 percent wheat malt. They are often roused during pouring, and, when yeast is present, will have a yeasty flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel.
