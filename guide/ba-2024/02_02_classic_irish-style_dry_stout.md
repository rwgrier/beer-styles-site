# Classic Irish-Style Dry Stout

- **Color:** Black
- **Clarity:** Opaque
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** The prominence of coffee-like roasted barley and a moderate degree of roasted malt aroma and flavor defines much of the character. The hallmark dry-roasted attributes typical of Dry Stout result from the use of roasted barley. Initial malt and light caramel flavors give way to a distinctive dry-roasted bitterness in the finish.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** European hop character may range from not present to low in aroma and flavor
- **Perceived bitterness:** Medium to medium-high
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Fruity esters are low relative to malt and roasted barley as well as hop bitterness. Diacetyl is usually absent in these beers but may be present at very low levels. Slight acidity may be present but is not required.
- **Body:** Medium-light to medium
- **Additional notes:** Head retention should be persistent
