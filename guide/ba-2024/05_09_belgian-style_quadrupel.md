# Belgian-Style Quadrupel

- **Color:** Amber to dark brown
- **Clarity:** Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures
- **Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor:** Caramel, dark sugar and malty sweet flavors and aromas can be intense, but not cloying, and should complement fruitiness.
- **Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor:** Not present to very low
- **Perceived bitterness:** Low to medium-low
- **Fermentation Characteristics:** Perception of alcohol can be strong. Complex fruity attributes reminiscent of any of raisins, dates, figs, grapes, or plums are often present and may be accompanied by wine-like attributes at low levels. Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma may be present at low to medium-low levels. Diacetyl and DMS should not be present.
- **Body:** Full with creamy mouthfeel
- **Additional notes:** Head should be dense and mousse-like. Quadrupels are well attenuated and are characterized by an intense alcohol presence balanced by other flavors, aromas and bitterness. They are well balanced with savoring/sipping-type drinkability. Oxidized character, if present in aged Quads, should be mild and pleasant.
