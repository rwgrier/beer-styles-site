<h1>Important Attributes</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sweetness.</strong> A mead may be <em>dry</em>, <em>semi-sweet</em>, or <em>sweet</em>. Sweetness simply refers to the amount of residual sugar in the mead. Sweetness is often confused with fruitiness in a dry mead. Body is related to sweetness, but dry meads can still have some body. Dry meads do not have to be bone dry. Sweet meads should not be cloyingly sweet, and should not have a raw, unfermented honey character. Sweetness is independent of strength. Note that tannin levels can affect the perceived sweetness of mead (more tannin makes a mead seem drier), but acidity is more related to the quality, balance, and enjoyment of the sweetness. The purpose of identifying a sweetness level is primarily to aid in the ordering of a flight. <em>Minor differences from stated sweetness level should not be heavily-penalized or considered a disqualifying fault.</em></li>
<li><strong>Carbonation.</strong> A mead may be <em>still</em>, <em>petillant</em>, or <em>sparkling</em>. Still meads do not have to be totally flat; they can have some very light bubbles. Petillant meads are lightly sparkling and can have a moderate, noticeable amount of carbonation. Sparkling meads are not gushing, but may have a character ranging from mouth- filling to an impression akin to Champagne or carbonated water. <em>Minor differences from stated carbonation level should not be heavily-penalized or considered a disqualifying fault.</em></li>
<li><strong>Strength.</strong> A mead may be categorized as <em>hydromel</em>, <em>standard</em>, or <em>sack</em> strength. Strength refers to the alcohol content of the mead (and also, therefore, the amount of honey and fermentables used to make the mead). Stronger meads can have a greater honey character and body (as well as alcohol) than weaker meads, although this is not a strict rule. Well-made stronger examples may have difficult-to-detect strength. <em>Minor differences from stated strength level should not be heavily-penalized or considered a disqualifying fault.</em></li>
<li><strong>Honey variety.</strong> Some types of honey have a strong varietal character (aroma, flavor, color, acidity). If a honey is unusual, additional information can be provided to judges as to the character to be expected. Note that <em>wildflower</em> isn’t a varietal honey; it is specifically a term used to describe a honey derived from an unknown source or from mixed flowers or blossoms. Consider providing a description of the honey if it is not listed in the Mead Exam Study Guide or other BJCP references. Identifying the source (state or region) and season of the honey can be useful information for the judges.</li>
<li><strong>Special ingredients.</strong> Different styles may include fruit, spice, malt, etc. Judges need to understand the ingredients that provide a unique character in order to properly evaluate the mead. Oak additions do not have to be specified (but may be at the entrant’s discretion); <em>oaking is acceptable in every mead style</em>. Excessive oaking is a fault, just as in wine; any use of oak should be balanced and complimentary. A declared use of oak should not be interpreted as requiring the oak to be a primary flavor.</li>
