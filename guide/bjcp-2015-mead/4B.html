<h1>M4B. Historical Mead</h1>

<p><em>A <strong>Historical Mead</strong> is a historical or indigenous mead that doesnâ€™t fit into another subcategory (e.g., Ethiopian tej, Polish meads). The BJCP welcomes submissions of writeups of historical or indigenous styles that fit into this category.</em></p>

<h2>Overall Impression:</h2>

<p>This mead should exhibit the character of all of the ingredients in varying degrees, and should show a good blending or balance between the various flavor elements. Whatever ingredients are included, the result should be identifiable as a honey-based fermented beverage.</p>

<h2>Aroma, appearance, flavor, mouthfeel:</h2>

<p>Aroma, appearance, flavor, mouthfeel generally follow the standard descriptions, yet note that all the characteristics may vary. Since a wide range of entries are possible, note that the characteristics may reflect combinations of the respective elements of the various sub-categories used in this style. Refer to Category M1 for a detailed description of the character of dry, semi-sweet and sweet mead. If the entered mead is a combination of other existing mead categories, refer to the constituent categories for a detailed description of the character of the component styles.</p>

<h2>Entry Instructions:</h2>

<p><em>See</em> Introduction to Mead Guidelines <em>for entry requirements</em>. Entrants <strong>MUST</strong> specify carbonation level, strength, and sweetness. Entrants <strong>MAY</strong> specify honey varieties. Entrants <strong>MUST</strong> specify the special nature of the mead, providing a description of the mead for judges if no such description is available from the BJCP.</p>

<h2>Commercial Examples:</h2>
